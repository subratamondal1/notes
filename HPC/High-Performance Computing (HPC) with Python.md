# 1. Introduction to Python Memory Management

### 1.1 Reference Counting and Garbage Collection
- **Memory Allocation in Python**
  - Variables point to memory blocks.
  - Python uses reference counting to manage memory.
- **Reference Counting Mechanism**
  - Each memory block has a reference count.
  - Count increments when a new reference is made.
  - Count decrements when a reference is deleted or reassigned.
- **Garbage Collection**
  - When reference count reaches zero, memory is freed.
  - The garbage collector reclaims unused memory blocks.
- **Memory Reuse Considerations**
  - Memory blocks may not be immediately reused.
  - Implications for numerical computations and memory efficiency.

# 2. Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) in CPython

### 2.1 Understanding the GIL
- **Definition and Purpose**
  - A **mutex** that protects access to Python objects.
  - Ensures that only one thread executes Python bytecode at a time.
- **Analogy: Children's Storytelling Game**
  - One toy (lock) allows one child (thread) to speak.
  - Others wait until they acquire the toy.

### 2.2 Multithreading in Python
- **Thread Execution Behavior**
  - **Threads appear to run in parallel but are serialized by the GIL.**
- **CPU-bound vs. I/O-bound Operations**
  - CPU-bound operations are limited by the GIL. (Threading is useless)
  - I/O-bound operations can benefit from threading. (Threading is useful)

### 2.3 Releasing the GIL in Extensions
- **C Extensions and GIL**
  - Extensions can release the GIL during long computations.
- **Impact on Performance**
