# Probability
## Definition
### Experiment
- A planned operation that is carried out under controlled conditions.
	* Coin toss is an Experiment.
	* Throwing Dice is an Experiment.
### Sample Space
- All the possible outcomes of an Experiment. Denoted by Omega $\Omega$ S or U.
	- E.g: Tossing a coin. $\Omega$ = {H,T} = 2
	- E.g: Throwing a dice. $\Omega$ = {1,2,3,4,5,6} = 6
### Event
- Subset of Sample Space.
	- Total number of events = $2^{\Omega}$
		- E.g: Tossing a coin: T. Events = $2^{2} = 4$

### Probability
- A function that maps an event to [0, 1] Range.
	- E.g: Probability of getting a Head = 0.5
	- E.g: Probability of getting a Tail = 0.5
	- E.g: Probability of getting neither tail or Head = 0
