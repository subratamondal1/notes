# Probability And Statistics Part-1 | Maha Revision | GATE Data Science and Artificial Intelligence
Hello everyone welcome to PW Good afternoon All of you once tell me on the chat box whether the audio and video quality is good or not Tell me on the chat box once whether the audio and video quality is good or not Good afternoon Good afternoon Good afternoon All of you everything is clear let's go this session is of probability today Data Science CSC Mechanical All the children can come to study is it useful for everyone or right there is no such thing for Data Science because the syllabus of both is almost the same I am good absolutely cool okay Very good very good so today we will start and finish the whole probability of probability first we will discuss the whole syllabus of probability with you today what we are going to teach in the session and how will we teach so this will be a session of about seven to seven to eight hours almost in a minute in which we will revise the whole probability okay absolutely Aarish man Chakraborty has got the first rank Absolutely, we will also do the maxima minimum thing, apart from this, we will also look at all the concepts that are tough. So, today we will start the session here. Before starting the session, let me tell you a little bit about what we are going to target, how we are going to study, and it will be a little long session. So, keep a little patience because if we have to play for a very long time, then we will have to keep a little patience. Only after patience will we be able to understand things. You will have a full day tomorrow, you can revise all the things. Tomorrow we will also have a telegram session. So, we will tell you many things there as well. So, see what all we are going to see. First, we will see this. We will first revise the basic probability and this is very fundamental. It will be used everywhere. At least, almost throughout your journey, this is going to be the probability. Apart from this, we will see and random.
Variable and Y variate random variable Children face a lot of difficulty here
All children please come this is for CSE as well as for data science all the interest is very good Rudra our people are going to study for seven to eight hours today so have a lot of patience because without patience long classes are not possible for you maintain concentration also so we will study basic concept of probability basic concept means we will see base theorem in this conditional probability in this everything right apart from this we will see random variable y variate random variable we will see all distributions poison normal uniform chi square everything is going to be seen everything is clear after this we will see sampling distribution a little bit and after this test of hypothesis all this is our complete syllabus when we start this syllabus First of all we start with probability, so we will tell you from the basics, you have to start from the basics only, your notes will also be made, it is clear that if you need to make notes, then your notes will also be made here, right, so what we have to focus on are short notes and fundamental concepts, you know in probability we have given you at least two question papers, almost two question papers, so you have to keep in mind that you have read these two question papers, I am assuming that you have read the complete notes etc., the slide will be shared, there is nothing to be afraid of, apart from this it is also revision, we will do revision in it, apart from this we will also make short notes, apart from this we will focus on many problem solving techniques, right, the one who has not done anything, he will also sit and will get benefit from it. What is the main focus? We have to put a lot of emphasis on problem solving skill.
Okay, we have done it in the university, we can do it directly, we can do it for sure. Beginners can also do it, there is no problem. Even a beginner can do it, there is no issue in it.
Okay, let's start the session now. We will look at problem solving skill. First of all, let's understand what is probability. Let's revise it once. Anyone can do it. Mechanical, Civil, Electrical, Electronics, Data Science. Syllabus is same for almost 60% of the students. We have already done PYQ. We will also look at PY here. We will take whatever is needed. Apart from this, we will mostly focus on how to improve our problem solving skill because time is very less that you can do it. If instead of reading behind the questions, you look at the fundamental mind, how the problem is approached, then you will see that.
Okay, now we stop talking here. Apart from this, we will directly teach you, so let's start with probability first. So, in probability, first of all we have to see what is the basic, so first let us understand the basics. Let's see, what is probability, let's understand here. Probability means it is for mechanical as well as civil. Everyone can study it. If you put your mind to study, it is better for everyone. Vikas has written a notification. He has put it up. You can see what is probability, let's first understand it. So, look, probability is nothing, just a course of chance. What does probability tell us about what is going to happen? It tells us, so what does it mean that probability e of
event equals a upon n What do we have to keep in mind Number
of favourable Here in mind Number of
we will see the question Now first understand a little basic Number of favourable outcomes Divide by the possible
outcome What is this basic definition of ours The basic definition is that Number of favourable outcomes Divide by the possible outcome Understand it very carefully Here if I am saying probability of e
equal to whom will a upon n mean Number of
favourite events Meaning of favourite events whatever you want Right
clear Number of favourable or number of desired You can also write it Divide by
the total We can do this work or we can also write it like this If
area is given in the form Number of favourable
region Divide by
the total region Did you understand what do we have to do Number of favourable region Divide by the
total region or number of desired outcome Divide by the total outcome. For example, if I

see an example of a dice in front of you. Understand it very basicly. In an hour, we will show you the total probability. With a little patience, even throwing a die will solve the problem. But you have to have some patience. If you throw a die, what kind of an event is throwing a die? It is a random event. We have taught you this to the children of the tree as well. Is it a random event or a random experiment? If this is a random experiment, it means that we will get some outcomes from this. What will be those outcomes here?

See, those outcomes will be either one or two or three or four or five or six. These are the outcomes that can come. This means that if two or five or six are thrown, what outcomes can come to us? What are our outcomes? If this happens to us, what will be our outcomes? If there are outcomes, then it means how many events are created here? Many events can be created. Event of one can be created. Event of two can be created. Event of three can be created. Event of four can be created. Event of five can be created. Event of six can be created. We can also say that this can also be created here. Event of prime number can be created here. Event of composite number can be created here. Look carefully. Many events can be created here. Number of bigger than three can be created here. Number of smaller than three can be created here. So many events can be created here. What does it mean? The outcomes that have come here, what have we created from there? We have created event. So what do we know about our outcomes? Listen carefully and try to make notes here. The relation of the outcomes is linked to which event. What relation is linked to which event? What can be the event from the event? Visualize it in your mind. e1 e2 e3. And all these events can be clear. It means that whatever Our outcomes were our sample points or our sample space, from that what event have we created, from that what event have we created, so what event will be there, it will be a subset, because if we consider it as a set, then from this set what have we created, a subset has been created, this much I understood, the basic thing is that from the outcomes that we got, what have we created a subset, subset means what is a subset of events, here many events can come, if I say now what will be the probability of event one, then what will you write, probability of event one equals number of numbers of event one and total we have to keep those numbers on top, which are our favorites, which we want and what will come in total, the total will come in divide, if suppose I continue the example of dice further for you, then if you see that on the dice we got six outcomes, we had clear results. How many outcomes were there Six outcomes means that if
we are getting six outcomes on the dice then what will be the probability of each event
we assume which one is one e2 let's assume 2 e3 let's assume 3
focus very carefully e5 and suppose
e6 we have total six events if their six outcomes are formed then the probability of
what did we get 1 up 6 because we know that
what is the probability of one the probability of one coming so the probability of
can be written like this what will be the number of dot v divided by total see carefully the number of
once the dot one comes divided by 6 if I want to find the number of dot two
then once dot two comes divided by 6 if you people play dice then you should know this thing that if we look at the dice then dot dot dot 4 dot 5 dots and 6

dots total such outcomes come it means how many dots do we have how many
times will dot
come once see here once so how many times has it come one divide by total
it is simple maths if I say dot 3 then dot 3 will also come once 1/6 it means
probability nothing but is a frequency we can say that what we want will be in numeration what do we want in numeration desired
outcome and what do we want in denominator total outcomes if you know both these things then probability is for you very simple game how will the problem come where will the problem come
in finding the desired outcome I said wrong in finding the total outcomes
or right tell us a little on the chat box where do you face problem in probability in desired
in and total I said wrong we have the most in desired and total
If you face any problem then if you command on desired and total then this portion of probability will become very easy.
What do we want to find out?

Divide the total. Now first we have to understand the basics. After that we will ask questions.

There are many questions and there are such questions which have not been asked here or in the paid batch. So keep watching carefully here. So did everyone understand one dice or not?

Tell me that everyone understood one dice. Now see how you should keep it in your mind.

Now we will see for two dice. Here we have to touch the entire syllabus and make each and every thing crystal clear to you. Now we will take throwing a two die. Now we will understand the game of two dice. Now we will also teach you permutation combination. Right.

Divya, read it here. There is no problem. The syllabus of probability is almost the same. So you can read it here. Throwing a two die.

How did the meaning of two die come into being? Understand it like this. There is confusion in your mind that throwing one die twice. Understand the throw, look here, first I will write it carefully in the notes that this die was thrown two times, one is this event, right, the other is that there are two different dies, die A and die B, if die A and die B are drawn as similar ones, keep in mind, look here, a very important thing is similar tens or similar nines, draw these two dice, we draw similar ones, now see how many of them will come in this, if we throw two similar ones, then see how you have to create a sample space, so if we have a sample space, we should know why because we have come to know that we have desired and we have to find the total, then how will the total come out, unless we analyze the total experiment, then what does it mean, what do we need now, total element, if we get the total element, then the work will be done So how will we get the total element? Look, how will we make die A and die B? We will use it. All this will be very useful in the exam. Either we can make it using a tree diagram. What can we make? Or we can use a diagram. Here, all the children know the tree diagram. They know how to do it. Look carefully near die A. Four F and six. Die A has this total element. Die B also has six elements. Look carefully. So it is clear. So we have six near die A and six near die B. When these two are thrown together, how will it be? Look here, first use this method. How do we do it like this? One is done and then I will make it once. I will not move forward. Four F will be done like this. Then two is done separately. Look carefully. If we make this one, it will take a long time. What else should we do? It is better to do it very comfortably and smoothly. You will understand the entire probability in seven to eight hours. So that's why keep watching carefully, what will we use now, we will use it, using grid method, understand that this is a strategy which you will not find in books, to place the die easily, so what does the grid method say, look here, the grid method says that, keep die A here, make a six out of it, learn this, make this die at another place, make a six out of it too, now it's clear, die A has a six and die B has a six, when both of them work together, then look, they are going to work together, multiple working together, see, now Shubham will tell you a little, have patience, right, you have done it very well, so here, now look at the first dice, understand very carefully, on the first dice, one will come on the first dice, one will come on the second one too, suppose there is a boy named Vaibhav, look here, keep it in mind carefully, there is a boy named Vaibhav and there is a boy named Shubham, right, there is a boy named Vaibhav and there is a boy named Shubham, so Vaibhav has a dice, he threw it What happened on this dice? Suppose two came up and what can come on this? If any number came on this, suppose four came up. If this is how it is happening, then throw the dice again, then see the total, two can also come. What will come here? 2 3 2 4 ... The total number of
favourable divide total so what did you get how many favourable did you get
six balls divide
36 1 ​​up 6 how much did you get 1 up 6 not clear
were not late at all we have just started and we will go by the basics even if it takes 8 10 hours right then its meaning here
how much of the same number came out /s it means related to dice if related to two dice
if any problem comes then you will solve it if I ask you see here I am
writing here if I ask you the even on the dice should be greater than
s you will find it CS students can also see it absolutely
the even on the dice will be greater than 11 you can find it quickly
tell me if any question comes related to two dice will you be able to solve it or not all children tell us all children we need at least 150 children reply to us on this chat box all children reply to us very carefully if any problem related to two dice If any question comes from two dice then you will not leave it, you will prove it in the paper, did it shine or not, it is very good, if it shines for you, then let us see the game of two dice Now we will see what happens with two coins here, we will see all the experiments

So that fundamentally all things are settled in the mind, now we will see

Toss is just an example, we have to see two coins, look carefully here

But now we will also teach you permutation combination in between where you will face difficulty

Now let's wait MTA, this question is done, conditional probability

It is clear whose question is done, conditional, then this will come next son don't worry

Now tossin is a two coin, what does two coins mean, one coin of Rs. One is a coin of Rs. Two, we have right Rupee one has two outcomes, either it can come head or tail, Rupee two also has two outcomes, either it can come head or tail, clear Rupee one also has head, Rupee tail also has head, Rupee two also has head, Rupee two also has head Now we make oil here

Use it using tree method or grid

So here the tree will be very simple so here we can apply this, grid will also be simple

So how will you do it here listen carefully, first look at the coin which has head and tail then

second coin which has head and tail head and tail so let us find the total outcome sample

A question related to this has come in the paper so listen carefully this is head

Head this is head tail this is tail head this is tail tail so how many total four outcomes did we get, did we get it or not

This is how many outcomes four outcomes now see what all questions will be made I

will tell you see what all questions can be made related to two coins see this I

asked what is the probability or look carefully this is

Probability getting one

Head if asked what is the probability of one Head this is absolutely for CS also you can read it right so how will we find the probability of one head we need one head so how will we get the probability of one head where is it for CS students brother where is one head one is here and one is here this is called one head we have to keep in mind now children get confused sir says there is one head here also no this is two head and what is this zero head carefully see the confusions that happen have to be seen carefully so how much did one head come one head means that our favourable outcome is this and one is this this is our desire desired means this is what we want so what did we get number of desire and divide it total so number of desired how many u total how many four how much came 1 one this question can come and this We have already told you to make it simple so that it is clear to you and see what other question can come, let us understand the second question, so this has come and see what is the probability is the probability, getting at least one head, this is where we have to learn this concept, at least one head, now all the children should listen carefully here, if I am talking about at least, then what does at least mean, at least means this, look here, when we made this, look here carefully, at least one means that either one head will come or one head will come, and whenever at least is talked about, keep it in mind, at least means either one D will come and maximum how many Ds can come, see, maximum how many Ds can come, either one D will come or two heads will come, so on what the concept of least is based, look here carefully, how to write probability of Look at that too

If at least one head then how will you write it as probability

x At least one head this is called at least what do we call this survival and death

Probability also gives the same notation it will be useful in future see now what does at least one

head mean either one head will come here listen carefully you will make mistakes now or then

2500 or two heads

will come most of these mistakes are made by children because these are fundamentals you don't understand their value why

because you think that we know all this and these concepts seem to be there even before us

so please please please enjoy the lecture comfortably and if you want to make your mind on fundamental things then

at least one head can come or two heads so what to do with the probability of both of these

if you want to add then how will you do it why are you adding this also understand it is a subtle thing why are you adding

because this one head coming and two heads coming Both of them are performing individually
When one head comes, then the one with two heads does not matter
When two heads come, then the one with one head
Meaning, it is not clear so what does it mean probability
Of probability of one head plus probability
Of two heads, this has come, it is clear, now we will do the permutation
Combination, don't worry, so what does probability of x i 1 x i 1 mean here one head
How many times is it coming, count them, so let's count them, this one is coming, this is coming, this is one
So what is its probability 2 up 4 now
We have to find out the probability of two heads what does probability of two heads mean
This is coming only once, it is clear, so how much did we get
Plus 1 up 4 how much did we get
Total 3/4 Did you understand that if the concept of at least is spoken, then what is to be done
See here from where it started
From starting to maximum number of experiments, how many times have these trials been done?
If you understand this, then if this thing gets into your mind that what is the concept of at least? 


Now let us come with one more concept and let us see. Wait, now if it comes, you have the probability of at most one head. Now you have the probability of at most one head.


What does it mean, understand it here

It is a very subtle thing, the meaning of at most is this

It happened, if you want to understand the meaning of at most, then see how we did the experiment, keep it in mind, HH came, HT came, TH came, TT came

If I talk about double H, right, yes, then also it is correct, educational academy came,

Yes, when we talk about at most, then how will we find out, in at most, we have to see

We do not need more than one head, what does it mean

Look, I have written it in Hindi also, so don't get confused

You do not need more than one head, we do not need more than one head, at

most, maximum to maximum, how much can we have, one head, it means whenever we

talk about at most, it means we talk about minimum random variable,

Did you understand? We will explain later, so how much can be made, see,

So zero head can come or one head can come, this is what will come, understand very carefully, so what
should we do? So zero head came or one head came, only these two can come Shivam I understood, you can read it comfortably, either zero head can come or one head can come and it is not that both of them are working individually, they are working together, both are different, understand it like this, what does it mean, if you add these two, then probability at most is its symbol this is, children are very confused because we keep looking at the group at least and at most, so what is the probability of at most, a greater lesson and probability x equal to 0 head plus probability x equal to one head, this is it, let's do it now, so what does zero head zero head mean, if not even a single head came, then not even a single head came, it means this zero head with one head, this and this this is one head is clear, it means what answer did we get, we got the answer, we got 1 up
4 P 2/4 I 3/4 This came out Look carefully, did you understand the concept of at most and at least All the children understood the concept of at most and at least Did you understand it? Tell me quickly If you understand the concept of at most and at least, then all the children should write on the chat box It will be better if all the children write on the chat box
Okay, so if you understood the concept of at most and at most, then will you toss three coins and take it Now look here
But toss three coins Now you people will do it I will not do it Now you people do an example So that you get to know the fundamental So first you have to take it out here Look one head two head three head one Let's do it All the children do it quickly Yes I will tell you Vikas Don't worry keep studying now start [praise] Stay the answer will be the same The answer will come the same once Let us explain the even number again.

Vaibhav, don't worry, all the children do this.

Yourself to sing a three coin. Take three coins in your copy. Rupee one, Rupee two and Rupee were.

Make it with three coins. All the children should see fundamentally.

Let us explain Shubham, what is random way? From here, you will understand random variable.

You will understand Shubham, first do this. Now you will understand random variable. Do this first.

Brother, we will finish it till night. So tie your waist belt and sit comfortably.

Stay seated with your waist belt tied.

Shubham, now whoever did not understand it, tell quickly.

Whoever did not understand it, tell.

Whoever did not understand it, tell. Very good, very good. Many children have given answers. I want the speed of the chat to be increased a little. And all the children should answer us. Pawan, you can definitely attend. If your syllabus is going on, then definitely attend.

All the children should attend. We can tell you whoever did not know probability in the syllabus, immediately all the children should respond on the chat box and tell all the children should attend there is no need to ask anyone it is simple and reply to the comments a little fast we are feeling that the public is sitting very much Kamalkant sir I am not able to make the total outcomes let us make it now let us make the total outcome see now tough questions will also come here first simple so see what is your level of preparation brother look here Rupee one has head and tail Rupee two also has head and tail Rath also has head and tail these three assume different levels if you do not understand like this A B person C person these three yes come out of the quilt it is better these three people have drawn simile real what have they drawn simile real what have they drawn when If simple real has been drawn then it means we make the total of all these then see what will be the total outcome here now we will teach you to do it as well first learn to measure the pattern what total outcomes are going to come first learn to make it then I will tell you the formulas for it first you are not making it look here head tail friend it is so simple and where will you get it I am not able to understand if you get it somewhere then tell me we can also read it you are being shown by doing one thing after another still head tail is not being made by some children half of the people try harder brother this total has come you can do it Sonu ok it means what will be the three outcomes now see can it not be possible that all the three boys got P D D when they did the coin it is simple simple then what came head D tail head tail head head tail tail head head tail head head tail random variable will also come out from here The children who have studied with us know it, so understand all this carefully, what does it mean, it has come here, listen carefully, it means you have to listen carefully again, so how many total outcomes did we have, how many total outcomes did we have, it is clear, now listen carefully here, it is eight, now look here

We will do the maths. What is the first question probability of one equals one head? We need one D. So how will we get one D? Look, now find the one-headed ones. So one head is here. Look, one is here. One is here. Tell me. How simple it is, friend. How much did it come? 3/8. Now what else can we do simpler than this?
Clearly, move ahead. Everyone should memorize the probability of two head. Now memorize the two-headed ones. See brother, where is two and one? Two three.
Easy, 3/8. Probability of what has been asked now? And how much did it come? Look, it is simple. It will not come.
Vim has come. We do not have to unsolve it yet. You already know the fundamentals. Let us do this. Understand this. Remove all the old things from your mind today. Remove all the old things first.
Go to this thing first. Okay. Anyway, you can do it.
Go ahead. At least what happened to one head at least? What did we tell you, either one head can come
or two heads can come or three heads can come, add all three
how much did you get? 7/8 is clear, move ahead now what are we asking now next see what is asked at most two
heads is interesting do a good job of probability it will be useful in future
it has come a lot it takes some time learn slowly now y
x equals 0 means not even a single head came plus one head
has come out now look here one thing has to be taught
that is why this question has been given to you now look what thing has to be taught or think now look here
but what does it tell you, look here carefully you will listen to me very carefully and all
the children will respond on the chat box, this tells you look here carefully what all could have happened here look at this experiment then zero heads can come
one head can come two heads can come three heads can come this is what can come see

Carefully and if I look at the old curve, look here zero D can come, one D can come, two head can come, these can come, this shows that if I take the probability of zero head then it is 1/8, if I look at it then it is 3/8, if I look at it then it is 3/8, if I look at it then it is 1/8, what does it show that as many as

will be together, friend, count it comfortably, look here now listen here, as many events will be there, what does it mean, look here I am writing, accept it, look here carefully, look here carefully, I am going to tell you a very serious thing which will be useful in future, it means the bigger the sample space, the more

events, so what are the events e1 e2 e3 e4 and this total sample

space, understand carefully here, the more events, the bigger the sample space is, so

events will be more, it should not be so, look once comfortably, ask for at most two heads, what does it mean at most two heads Either zero heads will come or one heads will come or two heads will come son, okay now look here what did we see that if I sum the probability of all the events, look here carefully, we need to look very carefully, then how many will come equal to one, what does it mean that if I sum all the probabilities then I get one, did you understand clearly, what will I get equal to one, and this is what we call total probability, listen very carefully, basic things, notes are also being made, your fundamentals, this is what we got, look at the second thing, we saw one more thing very carefully, we noticed this, look what did we do, we are making a figure, look here very carefully, if we have an event a, any event a in a sample space, let's assume that in throwing a dice we need one, then the one event is my favourite, it means what will happen outside one, you can see it completely, Vijay Singh ji, what will happen outside this, outside What will happen if one does not come means two will come, three will come, four will come, five will come, six will come, so it is clear that this event will happen, will it be of any use, and the one that is made outside will not happen, what does it mean that if the probability of happening plus the probability of not happening will be equal to one, because we have told that no matter how many events there are in the total sample space, they are always equal to one, so now look here, what does it mean that the probability of not happening, the probability of not happening plus the probability of happening will be equal to two, either we can say that the probability of one happening will be equal to one, it means that if we are given the probability of one happening, then what will happen that one will not happen, means one will not happen, what does it mean that either two will come or three will come or four will come, either five will come or six will come, this is what will happen What will be the answer 1 my ba s
equals 56 I understood that whenever the probability of one not happening
if asked then you can easily calculate die on one die on one clear break
you will get it or not you will get it right now we will tell you don't worry so did you understand how to calculate the probability of happening and not happening
so we got the dice clear we got the coin clear now let's see here


the most important thing which is most important we have to understand here is cards
because the card creates the most problem in problems right yes
you will get a break son you will get it of course come on we have coin done tell me quickly Achal
yes I understood coin I understood dice
one coin one dice both came no problem for anyone clear will tell you right now Vaibhav will tell you
it is in our mind don't worry Tiwari ji don't worry clear both these things were understood
dice coin Anything can happen. Now look here we understand the basic principle.

Some things which we need very much.

First of all, you will have to understand the first one.

Let's understand counting

Principal counting principle, understand carefully here.

Very
counting rules, let's see, let's understand the counting rules and the counting rule is very
important, let's explain the questions first, Sana Praveen.

Yes, let's explain a little, let's explain a little, after this we will only ask questions.

We will ask at least 20 to 25 questions in one line. First, let's understand the basics. If you can't do it, then you will face difficulty. So, first let's understand the counting principle. Look here carefully.

Now I am making a chart here.

Look here carefully. Now look here. Let's understand very easily.

You will understand counting and all the counting. It will be used in your gate, DA and anywhere in the world. Understand here.

CSC

people can see it, everyone can see it, for everyone, look here. So, look here.

Type clear number
Of permutation number
Of combination attention. Listen carefully, we will explain everything in these, we will give you all practical examples also, don't be afraid, there is no need to be afraid, look here, let's understand here, but if we have the first lot type, let's look here, now stop talking, look here, we have N different items, look carefully here and different items, understand very carefully, there is N different item, what does N different item mean, look here, we will explain each thing with examples, N different item here, look and different items, just keep it in mind, there is N different item, what does N different item mean, all the children sitting here are different items, all are different, suppose there are 340 children sitting here, watching the class, then these are 340 different items, did you understand my point, what can be taken in A B C like this, right, now I told you that if there is A different item and taking all at time, this attention Listen, we have to take all at a time, everything will be revised now, just have to fix it in your mind once, what does taken all at a time mean, what do you have to do with all of them, do you have to take out the permutations, take out the permutations, take out the permutations, if there is a different item and all of them have to be placed, then what will be the number of permutations, what is our problem, look, we will write the problem, our problem is that we have to take out n different items, right, order a coffee, it is clear, what does it mean, out of n different items, we have to take all at a time, so look, some children have made a mistake, look here, what do you have to make for this, look here, what do you have to make, whether you have a question in your exam, you have seen brother, there are n different items, then for that, the box method is the best, whether you study here today or go somewhere else tomorrow. Study MTech, do PhD then

What is the best method? Box method will give you the right idea

for this question. This is the problem. So there are n different items and taken all at a time.

If you want to do it, look here. Ask your mother to make it. Ask your Prateek aunty to give you a coffee.

Now with replacement and without. Later, Arindam will come here first.

Look, don't get confused. There are n different items. All taken at a time.

We have to take all at a time. So how did we do it?

For the first time, if I fill the first box, then the first box has n ways.

How many ways are there? There are n ways to sit here. Now, one way has gone here. So, how many ways are left for it?

N-1 ways to come here. How many ways are there left for it?

N-2 ways. N-3 ways. N-4 ways. N-5 ways. And the last one will have how many ways left like this. Understand the thing like this, look here carefully, you have to understand it like this, suppose you have a B C D E
five letters, right, if you have five classes, you have five
letters and all of them have to go in this box, look, this box is placed, firstly, the first box will say that in the first box, all these five
letters can come from any place, A can also come, B can also come, C can also come, D can also come, E can also come, so for the first one, there are five choices, how many choices are there, there are five choices, this is just one choice, you have to understand carefully, take advantage of things, now brother, this
box has been filled, four places are left, now he will say brother that B C D E which
four are left, suppose B starts filling, then what will B say, brother, I can go here also, I can go here also, I can go here also, but what will these four letters say brother, I am in this
box I can be filled in four ways.

Clear Apart from this, see how many options C has. Three, it will keep decreasing like this. The last one has clear. Now you can understand it like this. Look here.

And see the method. So what does it mean? This was the first job. This is the second job. Look carefully, understand it from the job. This is the third job and this is the last job.

W n is the job. What does it mean? If all of them have to work together. If all of them have to work together, then all the children tell whether it will be multiplied or added. All the children tell if they give all.

W1 job w2 job w3 job. If this is working together. We are working together. Then what should be applied here?

Multiply should be applied. Very good. So whenever this working together will happen, then we will multiply. So multiply n n - 1 n my 2 n my 3 last one. Clear. And in mathematics, this expression is called a factor.


torial or it is also written like this what is this
have you understood n
factorial if there is an item and taken all at time has to be done keep in mind
what is this this is a very deep thing if all at time have to be taken and placed together
then what will be the answer a factorial so we can write here in taken all at time
what is a so number of permutation what does number of permutation mean
what is a factorial which is ours what is number of permutation understood so what does permutation mean basically from here
we have understood the arrangement order in arrangement does matter understand the thing what does order in arrangement
does matter order matters why does it matter because if I say
a b and b give both different
order this is also the question you keep on understanding this and different order means what if we have different order then permutation must be happening Now what will be the number of combinations? Let us see this.

Look here. Secondly, if I have five elements A, B, CD, we have to make combinations of them. Look here. We have already read about it. Let us tell you again that combination means that you have to keep this thing in mind. Either group or selection or committee. If you have seen it in your school, it is okay Sakshi. Let us see here. Now pay attention to a little comment. First listen to me. You have to see in your school or college. If you have to make a committee of people from different branches in the entire college. Now all the children will listen to me carefully. If you have to make a committee in a college, right listen to me. If you have to make a committee of 10 students in a college, then listen to me carefully. Look, A, B, C, D. This is a panacea session. So listen carefully. We are going to make a committee of 10 students. Why are you teaching today? Why are you teaching with effort? Because you should at least get a rank in the top 10 in DA, at least two or three. So A B C D E, we have almost the same, my dear sir. We have five items, right, a different item. Now look here. We were talking about combination. Now look here. We have to make a committee of 10 students. Now tell us what will we do. Look here. We have to make a committee of 10 students. Right, in the school, there are four types of children. Mechanical, Civil, Electrical, Electronics, Data Science, Computer Science. Five types of children. Look here carefully. And I have told you what is the number of all of them. 10, 5, 8, 3, 11, 13. These are students. Okay, okay, it is clear. Manjeet, there will be no confusion now. Look here. You have to make a committee in a school. Understand the basics. The basics are clear. You have to make a committee in a school. There are 10 students out of which 10 are from Mechanical and five from Civil

8 from Electrical and three from Electronics

11 from DA and 13 from CS

What have I said? Look here, I said I have to take two students from Mechanical, three students from Civil, one student from Electrical and one student from D

One student from CS and one student from EC

Take two students from CS, look here

What will you have to use for this? Combination Whenever we make a committee or make a selection, what do we always use in this process?

If you understand selection or group in this, then what do we have

There are five items. Now tell me one thing. You all the students will tell me one thing.

Suppose I have taken two students in Mechanical

One's name is Shivam and the other's name is Ankit

Now see, you tell yourself. First carefully, I have taken two students in Mechanical, one is Ankit

One is Shivam, so what if I change their order, send Ankit here

And send Shivam here? What difference will it make? Will it make any difference to our selection? If we select two students, then either we keep Shivam as Ankit or we keep Ankit Shivam as Ankit. It will not matter. This means that I have also understood that order does not matter in selection. See, what a deep thing I have come to know. Did I come to know that order does not matter here? This means whether you take AB CD, CD AB, e CD AB, a BD C, are all these the same or not? See, this means that if I say n different items taken all at a time, then how many combinations are made? Tell all the children quickly how many combinations are made. If a different item is to be selected, then how many are made. This is the only way. So how many are made? Answer: One has to keep in mind that children get very confused in this. This means if you see the number of permutations taken all at a time, then n factorial and number are the same. If we look at the combination, one is clear to everyone. So in the answer, now we can write here what one take an object. Write it like this. Did you understand the first case? Now we come to the second case. There are many cases. Look, revision here means we have to touch everything and go through your mind. So sit comfortably. Now we take an different item here. Look, the item taken at times [praise] means yes, that is why one has come clear. Now we said take a different item, but how many times is it at times? It is clear for CS students also. Yes, it can be different in permutations. So a factorial. Right, let us understand it here. Look, what has he said here? Look, the third step and different item here. Listen carefully to me.

r at a time now we have to take r at a time what does r at a time mean now understand my point here first of all don't be in a hurry that's why we have five objects how many objects are there five I said five objects and now you have to take taken three at a time means what do you have to make from three letters you have to form a word like this understand right so what do you have to do here taken three at a time how much do you have to take taken three at a time so how will you do it look here take three letters here the rule is what do we have to do from three letters number of permutations what will be formed see what will happen the rule is very simple it is very logical look here look carefully here first this is my first box so if we fill it then we have to take three so now what do we do let's try it for n first so if we try it for n then for the first one n items right for the second one n - 1 one is reduced n - 2 now If you want to do it for r then the last one will be left with n my r -1 Look carefully what will be left with the last one n my a myv keep this in mind
right now divide it for this and make three letters see here how many will be there for the first one five for the second one four for the third one three this is my dove job see this is my dot job this is my w3 job and if all three work together then what will be the dove job dot job w3 job how much did it come 5 in 4 in 3 equals how much did it come 60 now generalize what will come in generalize total number of ways number of ways what did you get a a myv n minus a myv y came clear you will multiply all these what will you get after multiplying see we will tell you you will get factorial a upon factorial a minus a this we will get what does it mean y n factorial upon n minus a factorial so number Of ways how many did we get total number of
ways where there is a different
item taken all taken are at
time so how much did we get a factorial n minus
a what do we call this in a
what did we do to aa what did we do to the permutator we permuted
what did we do to the permutator we mutated so what did we get this this number what is this
our number of
permutation and if we want to find out here r we have to take aa this is our success
Ratnesh suppose I have to take three letters that will be given in the question so how much did we get
look here 5 here p 3 aa how much did we get if you solve 5 p3 and 5 p3 how much will we get 60 is clear Tanesh
brother how much did we get 60 confirm so we got it easily suppose
look I have one more here look here I have delly one letter here
look clear What is one letter I have, Lilli, now what do you have to do with Lilli

What do you have to do with Delhi, look here Delhi is here, you have four letters from Delhi, you have to select four

letters and then what do you have to do with them, permutator

and what is taken four at a time, everything will be given in the question, now

we will get the question done, then we will know, I will see KGF later, first this

see, this KGF is your three letter word, now suppose there is five in it, then how much did you get, answer 5 p

f, I understood it clearly, what does it mean

what happened, if we have to find the number of permutations, then what rule did we get

we got the most effective rule for us

look carefully, let us clear it, let us move ahead, now what does it mean here

what do you write a p r factorial a, now we will get their questions done about probability, so look carefully, this is it

clearly understood, what do we do now, don't say anything to anyone Shashank he is wasting his time not mine his parents have told him to go and waste time now see here let us find out the number of combination what will happen now look at the number of combination here I have five letters look here carefully five letters from the five letters you physical science students take all look comfortably here the class is better five letters we have A B C D E five letters now I said look here a different item is for everyone this is for last time I have told you for last time if you don't have it then children will reply and different item is clear and what do I have to do take are at time what do I have to do I have to take selection I have to find out number of combination what is to find out number of combination so how will I find out see what is the rule here look what is the rule here look the simplest rule to find it here we have already told that whenever we find out number of combination If we find the combination then the order does not matter. Order does not matter will make it clear. What does it mean that if the order does not matter then what should we do first? First of all, what should we do? Find the number of permutations. And when we divide it by that much, the answer will come out. Let us see how. So the first thing that we have to do to solve this problem is to find the number of permutations. Let us find the number of permutations. So now see, there are five letters. So, let us take two at a time. We have taken two letters. Let us take it clear. So, first we have to do the permutation. What thinking do we have to keep in mind? This is a very important thing. What number of permutations do we have to keep in mind? First of all, we will keep this. After doing the number of permutations, the order does not matter. Then what do we do by that much? We will divide it. So, let us see how. What have we taken two at a time here?
Listen to me carefully, look, we make it ready, how can it be made here


Ga look I have to take two letters A B CD e I have
five in total so how to clear it look here I have to take two letters so how to take two letters
A B clear A
B A C
CD make it like this look here make it like this and
It is good look I am telling you the technique of making it look write AB CD like this write it here A
B CD first make the number of combination look here let us make the number of permutation so what is this A AB understand it carefully so that it always remains in your mind AD and A look ahead
B BB b
C then
BD and B this is made look carefully it is the magic of truth table this means CA is the magic of maths CB CC CD C look carefully just tomorrow's date
If you have to teach someone then teach them D C
DD E B E C
ED E this is out now see how
will we clear now what will we do look here carefully now remove the repeating ones
So Which are the repeated ones? If we look here carefully, if we look here carefully, if we have made a diagonal, we have made a diagonal. If we look here, these elements are my repeated elements, they are coming repeated. Look carefully, Pratik Sahu ji, are ours becoming repeated? No, it means that we should remove the repeated elements. What should we do with them? We should remove them. So, we will have to remove 10 elements. If we remove 10 elements, what will come out? What will come out? Number of combinations? Order of combinations does not matter. So how do we clear them? Look here, it is the simplest, so we will see number of combinations once. First, what is the formula equal to number of permutations, upon how many words have we been given? We had to make two words, so how much is taken, two at a time? If it had been taken three at a time, there would have been three. If it had been taken four at a time, there would have been four. So what does it mean? We will divide it by that much. So how much did it turn out? Divide it by r. So how much did we get? What did our number of combination turn out to be? So what is it equal to? This is equal to AC. We can understand this in this way. In basic Safer Principles, we mean what do we have to do? If we want to find out the number of people in a class, what do we do? If we divide the total number of hands by the number of students, we will get the number. Do you understand? If we want to find out the number of students in a class, one way could be this. We can make people race their hands. And we can count the total number of hands and divide it by the factorial. So this is what we got. So now let's try this. Now how many were being formed in this. See, there were five letters. So 5 p2 divided by 2 factorial. So how much did the factorial 5 come out upon factorial 3 upon

If factorial 2 is clear then how much will come out, see factorial 5 will come 120 upon this six

will come this two will come how much answer is coming 10 see carefully

or do it with this what will come out from this 5 s2 this

will come 5 s2 so what does 5 s2 mean you see here carefully so I write the NCR

formula here see I know you people I know this much

so now put it here 5 p2 so what happened 5 factorial 3

how much did the factorial come out yes recording according to this you will get everything we will give lunch break

will give everything Yash now first see the basics friend we have to focus more on these we can get

you will get everything if you work hard then what is our formula made formula made

our now we are going to get the question after this we will give a break NCR understood

when we will see the question probability and this Related Only after this we will take a break I am hungry right now time
How much has passed I am not even seeing the time I am so busy in teaching you I am not even seeing the time how much time has passed
What not I have learnt so much now let's see the third formula look here n different
item
item in which what is there look here in n different item p
alike q alike are alike now let's explain this thing
Look here carefully only after this we will ask all the questions
Explain this now hey eat everything friend you don't know nothing will happen in a day
Look here you will stay alive you have your paper now so look here now there is n different
item look here those who have not understood even then in GATE paper if
we were teaching then understand it here no problem look here there is n different item n
different item means that now we have different number of items
How look here in this p alike
is p a ja q one

like r

like there can be many alike right yes eat mutton comfortably eat whatever you want eat chicken eat chicken eat whatever you want eat p alike q alike and r alike means p alike like q alike and r alike this comes up big in the exam so you have to keep in mind p alike are q alike aa alike how look here you can have problem like this a a a a a bb b b c cc cc look carefully what does it mean p alike q alike r alike p alike u alike clear p alike q alike r a like what does it mean now here we have to find the number of permutations listen carefully where order matters let's see now how do we do p alike q alike aa a different how is this a total if we add all the items then it will become n total so n is different what is n different

what is it, it is different, look here p different q different r different but in this n

p are same q are same and r are same, so don't understand, watch unnecessary chat

Children are refusing. This is a humble request to all the students sitting here. With folded hands, I request you that you have come here to study, so make as much knowledge as you can from here. So how will you do this PLI? Look here, its formula will be Peel Alike and R Alike. How to do them? Look. The simplest is what we have to do. A factorial, which is the total, means P plus K plus R factorial divided by P factorial. Let us explain the factor of O. What is our result? We have got the number of permutations. So, let us increase the speed a little. But suppose I have a word. Look. Calculus, calculus has come. Now if we look at calculus carefully, this is a C, a C, this is right. Apart from this, an L, an L, a Y, look here carefully. A Y, this is not. What does it mean? Here, P.

Alike this is our P alike two Cs are coming to us why

Alike two Ls are coming to us a alike so y

R is coming to us do we have a alike or not look carefully

Did you understand clearly what it means

Whatever letters are coming, it would be better if you write it as a factorial

The total number of letters that are coming and what are you doing, you are repeating

What do you do with them, divide them, it would be better if you write it right so how much

Bana I have completely stopped scolding everyone look here so P alike u alike and alike

What does it mean so how many are there in total, look one two three cha pa 6 sa aa so what is the answer

Bana a factorial whatever similar letters are coming, divide them

The answer has come look carefully now anything comes friend anything anything else like now

Do it and show it you

People do this one all the children
Show it only after this Will you be able to do the question otherwise you will not be able to do the question our questions are tough do it today Achal there is nothing to do wherever the words are being repeated divide them did you understand Achal there is nothing to do all the words that are being repeated divide them on divide why did you do it because this C may come here whether it comes here it may come here it does not matter this L may come here it does not matter this U may come here it does not matter look carefully Nagendra that is why I told him to write A factorial total words otherwise you will get confused I told him once Nagendra can't you see you are under the quilt I feel yes it comes in aptitude also all the children should answer it I will do PIQ Ala R like question quickly for at least one hour non stop that will also come tack It will come, it will come, wait, don't do anything for that also, we have asked a lot of questions for that also.

Yes, right, we can easily do it. Mississippi will come easily [praise]

Yes, here the question is different. Here also this will come, this will also come, you can do it.

Now if you are asked, look, this formula, we have worked it out. What is this?

We got it, look here, write it down carefully, fill it.

Factorial, now how many combinations will there be, it will be one only.

Look carefully, what will be the number of combinations, it will be one. What will be the number of combinations?

It will be one, why will it be one because the order doesn't matter here.

Yes, we can do it son.

Order doesn't matter, everyone has understood clearly. If you have understood this much, then we will move ahead. Everyone has understood basic counting. Everyone has understood basic counting. Everyone has understood basic counting. Let's see here now. Look here.

One Counting and let's see, look here this is the most asked question

There are three letters and four post boxes

We have to find the number of ways

Clearly yes, all at time, the whole case is there in all these cases, I have explained it, I will write it again

If you have not remembered, what is this, taking all at a time, now we have three boxes, look here and there are four post offices, so now we will explain this by generalizing it, how will we do this, look carefully, make three letters here

Listen carefully here, this is the thing, children get most confused in this, if we ask questions related to this now, then

you will not be able to do it, look here, we have four boxes here,

understand, we will make you do it, look carefully, now we will teach random variable, now

we will teach discrete distribution, look carefully, we have a lot of time right now, we have three letters, listen carefully, how many

letters do we have Four Post Office Now look what some children do, look here, if they take this box to the letter, if they take this box to the letter, then it may go wrong, keep in mind what will happen, whose letter will go to the box, did you understand what it means, the first letter has how many ways four ways the second one has four ways the third one has four ways multiply all three, did you understand the power of four 3, what will the children do, the power of 3 for this is the color clear, so how much did you get, the power of four was so the number of ways equal to the power of 4, 3 understood, the lift and the floor are also exactly like this, if we have five people, look here carefully, we are explaining that also now and we have this lift installed, right, the lift will not go to the person, it is not possible that the person should go to the lift, keep this in mind, we will ask questions now and you will find out. Repetition is allowed right, so keep this in mind, this is a very beautiful example for understanding, right. Now look, you already know all the other things that

If we throw 1 dice, look here
If I throw three dice, look here carefully
What will be the number of ways here
Look 6 in 6 in 6 equals 26 or the power of 6
Did you understand this? Suppose I have 5 coins
We have 5 coins, then how many will be the total outcome? Look one coin two coins three coins four coins five coins This one has two this one has two this one has two this one has two
If we say this, yes the secret will go to the thirsty crow
If we say that here what will be the total number of ways?
This simple is real
So what will be the result? 2 * 2 * 2 * 2 * 2 equals 2
Power of 5
Look carefully all
Children are looking at the question right now, only the last one is left. Now this much basic has been understood. Everyone
understands the cards quickly. If we say this, we always have to remember that if the simple is real
Work is being done, then what will always be the result? Things to remember whenever working together

Write them down from your mind, we will multiply them and when it is individual, we will plus them

This much has been understood by everyone

Now we will tell you about the cards once more

After this we will tell you two more things

After this we will ask you questions again, let's talk about the cards and see what

is the basic basic thing, we have told you all the things, now let's understand

here, first let us understand the counting

method, understand one more thing which will create a lot of problems for you

in this counting method, what to always remember, look here, it doesn't matter, we are explaining

once on the chat box, everyone should tell whether they have understood

whatever has been taught till now or not, first tell them

quickly tell them whether they have understood as much as we have

taught them, everyone should at least bring their chat rate above 200

once, bring their chat rate above 200, then we will start teaching

the counting method again Let us now understand the counting method here. What is the counting method? After all, right. Very good. Seeing your energy, we have gained more energy. Now let us see the counting method here, which will be used the most. Then we will see the questions. Look here. First of all, let us understand. Look here carefully. We are just making the figure. We will not have to explain much because you all have already read everything. First of all, let us understand without replacement. What is without replacement? Let us understand this. So look here carefully. Yes, we will give a summary later. Look, we have three pink balls. Three blue balls. And I have two green balls. Let us understand here carefully. Niket ji, now, what do we have to do here? Listen carefully. What does our counting method say? What is the first method without replacement. What does without replacement mean? Look here carefully. Now we will explain it totally because you have explained the next thing. So the sampling that happens here.

Look carefully, the sampling is of two types, one is with replacement and one is without replacement. One is with and one is without. Understand carefully what is in without, that if I draw a ball once, then we cannot place it. Look, I draw a bar in the chart. What does without mean here, that if I draw a ball once, I have written that now I cannot place it back. It is not possible. I will not be able to do this phenomenon. What is the second one? The second one is very clear that if the ball is drawn once, then it can be replaced again. Do you understand? So there are two types of things, one is without and one is with. Now all the children should tell me this on the chat box that in the without replacement, the number of balls will keep decreasing gradually. What will happen to the balls in it? Balls are decreasing. Look here, when the balls decrease, it means

What will the probability be, it will start changing

Look carefully while what will happen here

Will the probability also be the same

It will remain the same

We have told this much, we don't have to enter it again, it's okay, let's go now

Look and if it doesn't come in writing in the question, then this case without

is the default, I understood this, I have to assume it in the question, this has to be kept as Ajman Lek

Clear, so let's see here, now what do we do, we have to find out what is the probability

P two yellow ball R

Draw the yellow ball, so draw the yellow ball, what did we get

Look probability two yellow, so we took out the first one, now one

two yellows will be left, we took out the first yellow, so how much did we get 3/8 now two yellow

two greens are left, look carefully and three pinks are left

Now I will take out the second yellow

So what did we get 2/7 Look carefully what does it mean if these two have to work together, the same old funda, this D job, assume this W2 job, assume
in mind, then both have to work together, then what will they get if they work together, the probability of two probability of two yellow balls, what did they get 3/8 in
2/7 6 up 56 came, look carefully what did we do, we multiplied it, it means whenever there is a case of without replacement, what things did we notice, now look at the things that we noticed, look what did we notice first, look here, the A remained, it means that the probability that the next event is affected by the previous event or not, all the children
tell the next probability all the children tell on the chat whether the previous one is affecting or not, look at it means if a case of without replacement comes, then you will understand from your mind that basically this
What kind of event is this? What kind of event is this?

Sorry dependent

Why is the event dependent, earlier it was eight, now what has become, what has become 8, now we also got to know

that the sample space has been reduced

What has the sample space become reduced, so always remember

Why can we do it wrong, friend Arjun Reddy sahab, use your mind a little

This is a dependent event, after this we also got to know that what is happening here

at the sample is being reduced, so now look here, suppose it is not necessary that there is only one

ball, let's see the case in this, look here we have six white balls,

Look carefully, clear and three, we have yellow balls

and we have green balls, now I have to find out the probability of six white balls, whose

probability of six white balls will be there, we will keep taking out one by one, clear multiplies came, that's why

Munna Bhaiya, you have studied the whole course, multiplies came, that's why everybody We are working together, look, I can show you by making a diagram, look here, first take out this, first ball, then second, then third, then fourth, then fifth, then sixth, look carefully, you can do it with Bano Miyal also, but you don't want to do it now, so look here, take out the first ball, white, first white, so how much did it come 6s, second, 5/1, third, look carefully 4 up, 10, then 3/9, then 2/8, then 1/7, look carefully, one by one, one by one, take out all these and what is all this, our white ball, this is also white, this is also white, this is also white, this is also white, this is also white, now what more can I tell you, it is useful for everyone, friend, so what will be formed here, this is the first work, this is the second work you did, this is the third work, this is the fourth work, this is the fifth work, this is the sixth work, apply multiplication to all 6/1, we are working together, so always multiply carefully Look

Here are the six white balls. Look carefully, we have found it.

Whose six white balls have come out? So, we have the probability of six white balls. And in this probability of six white balls, we can see three things. Look carefully, first the sample space is being reduced.

Look carefully, and everyone should respond to the chat. Second, the dependent event in energy is the third. The next probability is affected by a previous one. Look carefully.

Okay, yes, make it 5/1. Everyone understood this much.

Tushar, Pratik, Kajal, all the children sitting here, clearly understood this much.

Basically, these four things are happening and it is visible here. So, whose case is this?

It has come without replacement. Now we will see with replacement. And after this, we will ask you questions.

Let us see what is with replacement. The second case is this. You will understand it quickly.

You will understand with replacement. Come here, see the same. Work
Let's increase the example, so that it is clear and there is no problem in understanding it. And here it is given. Now what does with replacement mean? This is the last time I am telling this to everyone. If you say, I will announce it on Doordarshan. If you say, I will tell Doordarshan. If you say, I will tell the Indian Government to issue a circular or gazette or notification. The children who want to take CS class today can take a break. We will give it in half an hour. I have pinned it and done everything.
Friend, now look here, the same work has to be done here also. Look here, the probability of six white is this. Son, if you have to read six white carefully, then how much is the value of six white. They will have to get the news flashed in BBC, while they know everything else. What movie is coming, whose movie is coming. If you see six white, then take out the first white. Ek Doti Cha Pa 6 Sa Na 10, then 6 Ba 10. Then 5/9 then 4/8 then 3/7 then 2/6 then 1 up 5 so this

so without replacement look carefully if I do this case then how would it be

without replacement but which case should we take

with replacement what does with replacement mean that here the denominator

and numerator both will not change it means if I do with

now look what will come in with

should you put the ball again in with then 6/1 the other one also 6/1

6/1 6/1 6 Ba 6

ba look carefully this comes out

did you understand what do we notice whenever with replacement is said if

see in a minute then first notice point chance and probability are the same thing never

change this is not changing right so from here

we come to know what kind of event is this it is an independent event why is it

independent because next probability is not affected

by previous probability If you understand then next

Probability will not take inspiration from the previous and if it does not take inspiration then what does it mean? We will call such an event

independent event. We will ask you questions. We will not even have dinner. We will make you sit till 12 o'clock at night. So if this is understood then what will we call such an event

independent. Did you understand any entanglement? Write whatever you want to write. Okay, let's see the next one. Now

Let us tell you one more card person that there are many children sitting here who have never seen cards. They have never seen cards. So we will tell them the cards and after that we will ask questions.

The cards will be good and new. They will get a chance to use their brain.

Look, if you understand the cards, then what are the cards. Look here, we have a total of 52 cards. Electrical people can see how many cards are there in total. 52 cards in both these cards. Look here carefully. These cards in both these cards.
It is divided in two ways

Things are like this, look at them according to one colour and one picture, one is red colour and one is white colour, look carefully, red colour and white colour are clear, what does red and white mean, look here carefully, divide both of them in half, so 26 cards and 26 cards, now look here, there are two cards here on which different pictures are made, now how will we do the identification, diamond and one is heart, Sushanta will tell you, okay, what is diamond and heart here, sorry, write black here, there are two cards in black, see which ones, one is club and one is spade, what does spade mean, spade means, write chidi like this, what does it mean, those who don't understand, write it like this, what does red heart mean, what does diamond mean, look carefully, how many are these in total, 13 cards, this is also 13, this is also 13, this is also 13, now these There is division in 13 cards also, see what is it, now these 13 cards, take any one, suppose I take the diamond, then it will be same for all, then what is it? There will be two types of cards, one will have a photo on it, go and buy it today and see, one will not have a photo, one will have a photo and one will not have a photo, the one on which the photo is printed, what is the Gujarati word for spade, I have no idea, Jadeja ji, there is absolutely one face card and one non-face, so what will be there in the face, look here, one becomes king, king, queen and one becomes jack, which means that there are three things in our face, so look here how many face cards are there, now tell me all of you children, how many face cards are there in total, when there are three in one, then how many will be there in four, how many are there in 12, what does 12 mean, king, jack and queen, king, jack and queen, which means queen, king and slave, what is there in the non-face, ace

Two three four four five six six Satta a Nahala

And ten if these come then how many are non face

Total 4 * 10 equal to this everyone has understood the card is a face

card is not a face card it has a face on it Aditya have you seen a face on it Aditya

We feel that you have seen a card from somewhere else you have not seen a joker have you seen a card from somewhere else there is no face on it so

there is non face and there is face right clear now you have to do one question right now I am giving this here see here this question related to this will open the thread of many of your

concepts total is 52 cards right

Now see what is the question here three cards are drawn here

Look are

drawn random one at a time listen to the question

have to find the probability

one of twos

cards jack queen and king do it quickly

we will get a poll done right now we need an objective for the poll we will also get it done

Do it Jack Queen King all the children

Show it do it quickly till then let's see how much time

is there take the black heart take it no problem

Do it all the children give the answer give it to at least 200 children

Then we will know whether you people are studying or not those who will do P Y Q in GATE will be solved immediately with this many lectures

Half the questions will be solved of other branches today itself read it properly friend what problem are you facing in it

This is of your branch brother this is of your branch

Son it is done whoever did not know it should tell quickly

Whoever did not know it should tell whoever did not know it should tell now look here here there are two types of

things happen first understand the thing if he says that first take it out then take out why then take out

King one is this case Kaushik will teach it see here if he

first says probability says what is the Look at the probability here carefully

You have to understand the difference between the two. Take out the probability first, why later

Take out the king. One, this is what is the second one. The second one in this is one of two
cards one of two cards one of two cards means a different thing has happened. This thing has become different. So, I will explain one question. All the concepts will be understood automatically. Those who did not understand it, please message once and

ask, look here, Priya ji, what did we do?

First find out here, there are four kings, four queens and four jacks. We have clearly

without seeing, this is the example. Look here carefully, what did we

do? This is our box. Look here carefully. Now, all the children should understand. From this box, I took out the first card. Look here carefully.

First draw, look here carefully. If you look carefully, otherwise you will not

understand, look here. All the children carefully, we did the first draw. We were taking out the first one. So, we took out the first one. Suppose, the king

then came to me. Queen came out again with me. Look carefully, the first time we drew three cards, the first card came out to be this, the second card came out to be this and the third card came out to be this. Everyone understood this. This is the first method. Look again. Look again. If you are not able to see it like this, then look like this. This is very important for all the children. So look carefully. Let us make all the boxes. Right here we have 52. Here also we have 52 cards. Look carefully here also we have 52 cards. Here also we have 52 cards. And here also we have 52 cards. Now why did we take so many? You will understand now. Look, suppose I draw three cards for the first time. Suppose the first person draws three cards. Suppose the first one is A, he drew K first, then K came out, then J came out. This became the first one. Now look, here the second one drew the first one. It turned out that JK can also be like this. The third one can also be like this. Jay turned out to be


Who knows what the D man said JK that this can also happen

What the fifth man said E brother, it can also happen like this because J and one more will be made

Look what the sixth man F said brother JK, look all the children can become this much in total, look carefully

Either this one will be drawn like this, he must have taken it out like this or he must have done this

He must have done this, he must have done this or he must have done this

Clearly and look when all these three cards

are drawn then it will be working together, look each and every thing is understandable

clear and when all these will be done then it will be working individually, look carefully what will be the working individual if plus

is applied then it has come, look carefully working

individual working together are these two matching or not, look carefully either it will be working

together and this one with plus will be like this now what to do add the probability of all

now look now first understand the concept Friend, don't memorize, we can answer the question in one line

We are not mad that we are using so many hands, no matter how these things entered your mind

This has been understood, now if you have to add the probability of all, then take out the probability, first see what the probability

will be and whose case will you take

I have always told without replacement, if nothing is given, then you will always believe

Look here, this is what will come

[Prasha] What will come first, see 4 Ba 52

Then Queen 4 Ba 51 plus 4 Ba 50 came first

It's done now Sushanta, if you message so many times, then you yourself will get scolded by us when

I have told you that I will tell you, I will teach you today itself, root test and T test, you know all this, then

ask the next question, wait a little now, plus then do it

You are not looking carefully here, friend, then you say that Sir, I don't understand

How will you understand the probability, the time when you have to understand it You don't understand the time at that time

Somewhere else, you are remembering the future, this has come [praise], if you add all these, you will get the answer

One way is this, it is called the simplest way, whenever one of two is said

you have to do it always like this, now let's see its logical way, how to do it logically

We will do this work quickly, look here carefully, four is remaining, hey Sheeta ji Mehta

Yes, understand from here, look here I have four kings, four queens, four jacks, a little

correct your mind a little, you will get it right, now look at this question with a shortcut

How will you do it now, look here, shortcut

Look, one of two is said

So how do we find it, look here, it is very simple, whenever one of two is said

what to do, nothing has to be done, the probability of the cards given

find out the probability of the cards given, then find out the probability of jack

Take it once, how much did it come 4 ba 52 4 ba
51 and 4 ba 50 It came out what will you do now
Look here the cards given by JK what do you do with them n different items
Look carefully we have put the same thing take all at time
The old three different items are for civil also for everyone for every student
J why is it now n different item take all at time what do you want to do
Give a factorial means multiply 3 factorial here
Understood find out the probability then multiply it by 3 factorial is this
The answer is here now see one more question based on this
Let's see then maybe more things will come to mind look here carefully this is the second one
Look we have a box look in this box two green
[Music] there are three blue look carefully this concept will become clear now
You will get two white [Music]
There are two red three red
There are four It is yellow, see, many colours have been given.

Clearly, now see, if I ask a question like this, look here.

First take out the white, then take out the red. Look carefully.

Take out the yellow, then take out the blue, then take out the green. First, is this question solved or not?

Look, Tushar Ji, all the children tell what he has done first. First, he is saying take out the white, then take out the red, then take out the yellow, then take out the blue, then take out the green.

Meaning, how will you find the answer to this? Look, first, if you have to take out the white, then 2 x 10 14 2 x 14.

Look, then if you have to take out the red, then 3/1. Then if you have to take out the yellow, then how much is yellow?

Look, if it is 4 x 12, then if you have to take out the blue, then 3/1. Then if you have to take out the green, then 2/1. Multiply all of them. First, this is it.

I understood. Second, the toughest question he asks in the exam is what will he ask in the exam?

He will ask one of those

Balls white red green blue

And yellow one can also ask this so if he asks this then what will you do you see it has been told in class

There is nothing to do then take out one of any

And what do you do with this look carefully all the children tell and

Different

Item taken all at time permuted

It has been understood by all so now let us ask you

Questions let us ask you quickly if you are ready for the questions if you are ready for the questions then tell us so we can start

Questions even this much will do if you study today then better work will do if you study today then better work will do so all the children respond once in a bang on chat box and by 3 o'clock we are going to ask questions now

Right let's do question number one then also it will be done we will ask that question now Let's do it Vaibhav, let's tell you now, let's tell you now, let's do some questions, I will give some for home, here, let's do it, let's do the first question, all the children, we will give you a break, let's do it quickly, question number one is wrong, wrong, wrong, Faran, yours is also wrong, read this question again

I have asked you this type of question too, but you had come too, probably

I think I remember it on the tube

It is wrong

Everything is wrong, Anvesh Nayak's is correct

Only PY, friend, we have done all of them, son, a boy named Anvesh Nayak did it right

I am fine Ajit Pal

Yes, don't get into drugs, first tell me the question, Data Science, yours is also wrong

Hey Adil, Adil, first answer this, what do you know, tell me quickly, Adil, tell me the answer to this, what do you know

Hey, all the answers are correct, the answer is correct

Hey, let's see how we will do it here, look here, we have a total of 30 books here

Look carefully, I have asked this question in class also, in some batch

How many books are there, we have 30 books, look here, we have three volumes of dictionary, we have to arrange them in arranging order here

Look, this is the v1 volume, this is the v2 volume of the book There is a book placed

and this is the 3 volume of the book

look carefully all the children we have three right what does it mean these three

volumes we have to arrange in increasing order in which order we have to arrange them in increasing order look the increasing order is written

look what is the question there is a three volume dictionary among 30 books arranged in a random way find the

probability of three volumes standing in an increasing order and left to

right so look here Pranjal ji you have not given the answer Chakravarti ji you tell me

look here the first will come first then the second then the third what can be the result of this

it can be in increasing order apart from this any other option is visible and

tell quickly any other option is visible first book

second book third book so we have to arrange three books in increasing order so

we have placed the first one then the second then the third we will arrange them in this way right like suppose we have to arrange
This is the tenth book 11th then 12th now 12th then 13th then 4th what is our
increasing order clear what does it mean what number of favourable has come or desired one there is only one way by which
we can put it in increasing order if I put it like this it is wrong
if I put it like this it is wrong if I put it like this it is wrong only this is correct v1 v2 v3 because this is an increasing order so this one has come now what is the total
become tell me you are not able to do this simple question what is the total outcomes now see total
outcomes will be we have three volumes one look here two
three it means what is the different
item taken all at a
time means 3 factorial has come so how much is our 3 factorial so probability
did 1 our 3 fto did you understand tell me quickly
if you understood If it has gone, all the children

said the answer

1 Prince, we have been given 30 books but we have to do three volumes

We have to find the probability of three, so that is our sample space

Son

Clear

Complication to fair die are thrown 10 times

10 times find the probability that the three throws result in seven and last

Not last three throws, last seven throws in sum of t

Do it for all, Harry bhai, do this question, think fast

If you don't get it, I will tell you

Don't worry, do it slowly

There is nothing different, there is a little difference, Faroj, is his class going on right now

Faroj no, then why are you writing it again and again, when it will be there, I will tell you

Friend

Pranjal bhai, do it quickly

Shubham, there were many children who study in paid batch, tell them

Brother, the Maha has started from today itself
Revision you guys tell the questions such a simple question Ars man Chakravarti you tell me
Brother you tell Chakravarti ji how will
everyone's answer come wrong everyone is wrong everyone's answer is wrong come on let's see I will tell you look here it's very simple friend why is it taking so much time look here there are two dice look here carefully I have two dice look here carefully I will tell Chakravarti ji you also see all the children see now add your answer and then tell me we have two dice total right so when we took the first dice and in this how many
were the total outcomes we got equal to 36 right how many outcomes did we get 36 look this is wrong Nikita you have done it wrong how are you guys guessing here listen again total outcomes I have 36 now I have two
dice look here then these are two you had to guess like this I don't understand how much time has been taken 10 times right, so the first one has
How many 36s, how many 36s on the second one, how many times 10
Times, how much is the total outcome
36 * 36, how many times 10 times now
Did you do all this maths, 36 to the power of 10, what did you get?
The total has come out for us, it is clear, the total has come out, now what do we have to find out
What do we have to find out, the favourable
What do we have to find out, how will we find out, look here carefully in the first three dice
We need even seven in three throws, how much is the even, so how will we get it, either
will come or 43 will come 52 will come 2 5 will come seven will come this will come, look carefully
See how many outcomes are there, six six combination and how many times three times
Because we need three, six is ​​made in this, six is ​​made in this also, six is ​​made in this also
If it is made, how many are there, the power of 6s, look carefully all the children
Now in the next seven
Now how much do I have to get in the next seven If I have to get one then take out one What will come in the first eight
53 35
62 26 What else will come
44 So how much did you get in total
Five how many times by the power of 5 This work and this
work both will be done together then what is the probability All the children will tell did they understand it
No Dubey ji I understood it


I

See all the children look and tell, it was the power of 6, power of 5 to the power of 36, 10, well if you did this then it is fine Chakravarti ji, the people who did this, their answer is correct,

It is a very good question for learning,

Specially a very good question for learning, if you want to learn,

If you don't want to learn then it is a different matter,

Give the next question, give the summary of the question again,

You didn't have to do anything, look here, the summary is very simple, we are making the whole diagram here,

Look, look here carefully, now

All look here, look at the summary, now look here carefully, let us tell the summary,

Look here, we have two dice, we have two dice,

Listen again, we have two dice and what is the total, it takes a lot of time to approach,

Son, we have taught probability lump sum at least 500 times, if not more,

At one place, we have taught in advance If I used to teach, then in a year at least 27 batches would teach

Probability takes a lot of time to explain things when it takes us a lot of time to explain then it will take time for you to understand as well

Look here it will come to 36 we are calculating the total of 36 look here

Carefully the child who has asked should at least answer carefully

If he gives the answer then the total has been calculated 10 to the power of 36 look

It will take some time a little time it takes a lot of time a lot

time right second look what has he said now learn to divide the problem into parts

If there is a problem in this piece then don't solve it completely make its pieces piece one

Piece two piece three piece four and piece five and then add all the pieces like in childhood

We play a game there is a map of India we have divided it right cut the different states separately and then add

it is problem solving ability so see what he is saying how much is coming in three

it How much is the sum given in three? In three, the sum is given. And what is the sum given in the next sen? 8 Look carefully, it is clear, so we have taken it out from here. How many eights did we make? Here, we got 3 to the power of 6. Here, we got 3 to the power of 5. This is the first job, this is the second job, then the whole job will be completed. We will work together. Both of you friends, you cannot explain more than this. We will stop here. So how much can we create a problem for someone. Now we will be able to do it. Now all the children can do it. This will happen. It will not be more than this. Power of 6. How did it happen? What is the name of this child? You don't understand the blog yet. You look here. We will get a total of six outcomes on two dice. What do you guys think, sir? Tell us some such technique that takes time. There is no such technique in mathematics. If we get this much total, we will get this in three. We will get this in this as well. We will get this in this as well. Next question
Come on to the next question

No, do the next question, do the next and then show it

Now we will give you three questions in the break, the situation will be less than this

We are giving lunch break, we are giving it, we are giving it, do the first question

First come and show it

Yes, we will get it done, Vaidya sahab will get it done

Do it quickly

Come on, no problem Pranjal, do this

Show me, take the digit, I have given the digit also

If you are finding all these questions right, then the selection is certain

Do it, Max is right

Your question is right

Shashank, see, nothing has been said, let's first catch the question, find the

Probability that among five random digits, digits are different, all digits are

Different and five random selected digits, we have to do it right, so how will we do it, see

It is very simple here The funda is what to do this

See we have five digits we have to select at random look here carefully

how many digits we have to select five and how many do we have in total 10

how many digits are there 10 digits look one twoti cha pa 6 sa 89 10 10 digits so if we

have 10 digits how many digits are there in total 10 right so what do we do first we have 10 digits

and we have to select five from them and all digits are different so how

should we do it look we have to select five so this one has 10 options this one has 10 options this one has 10 options this one has 10 options so find out the total

first how many total number of ways did we get how many
we will get power of 10 5 this is coming to power of 10 of all

see clear now what do we have to do five random We had to select digit and all

digits are different All digits should be different So all and different items we have to

select and different

items taken all at a

time So what happens to us, how will we do it, see 10 or 8 7 6 will come

If we took this, what was the answer

Favourable, all the children understood it, respond on the chat box

Yes, this is simple in the table, we will do it, all can do it with NPR also

Okay, let's come next question

Do one of the best question for

Show your understanding

Do it comfortably

Here all are different Sanjay Singh ji once questions

Read all digits are different All digits are

different, do it and we understood Faran, what are you thinking

Take any other, there is no problem

Yes, we do not have to make digits We don't have to make digits

Faran Sanjay once you see it everything will be done, just do it comfortably

Santanu yours is wrong

Gyani doctor ji

Please apply Khanna ji has come Rishabh it is not surprising what is the surprise

Tell me brother

Please tell me quickly tell me the answer I will explain you I will explain no I cannot say this Gyani doctor

Look here there is a ruckus in a city seven accidents happen in each week in a

particular week there usually one accident per day is it
surprise

ing oh nothing, find the probability
7 factorial, I am right with the power of 7
Oh, this kind of question has been asked
What will be the answer, tell me quickly, I will do it myself, I will not do it, if I
do it, then your concept will never be correct, this is the answer, I have to do it myself, anyway I will not do it, there will be a discussion on telegram
But I will not do it now, I will not answer all the questions, I will not answer it
Yes, compare it with the probability, is it surprising or not, if it is high then it is surprising, if it is low then it is not
surprising, let's do it as homework at home and I have to answer it, okay, you have to do it yourself, don't ask me, if you
ask me, you will miss the concept, that's why we have given the question, okay, let's see the next question, we are taking a break, now after doing one of my best questions

Show me, do this, explain this, give me a telegram

Note down the telegram, all the children take notes, Rahul Sir, P W

Now we will have a session on that today

Tomorrow do this, do this

Show me, yes that is right, Pranay, yours is right, let these children do it, now do this, we will explain it here

We will explain, very good, Chakravarti ji, very good, very very very good, the children

who have done it, it means they have understood the concept. 10

p7, understand it quickly, we will explain it

This is a very important property, counting

Important, most important, M person, A floors, M person

N block, no problem, I will explain it anyway

Now, whoever wants to understand, should react to this immediately and without wasting time,

ask quickly, see here, how will we do it, let us understand it, first we will read the question

Let us read the question, N elevator, lift stands with seven passengers, seven

passengers, sorry, how much money sen
one two look here three four
five six seven n two three four f seven there are seven passengers
how many passengers are there seven no problem look at this right now we are telling you there is no confusion
how many floors are there there are 10 floors look carefully there are 10 floors
one two three four five 6 sa aa n 10 this is 10
floors look carefully letter and box exactly this is
my 10 floors and this we have seven passengers
now see what has been asked what is the probability that no two passengers leave of the
same floor two passengers will not have to get down on the same floor this is the question question
all children look and tell me did you understand a little bit this much if you have understood this much then I will move ahead otherwise I will stop here tell me quickly that
here did you understand this question that we have seven passengers and 10 floors and asked what
that no two Passengers leave of the same floor so let's how to do it

See what is the probability equal to we have to find out no two

Passenger same floor divided

by total this is what we have to do so see how to do it

It is very simple never forget after today look here what to do first we have to find out the total first so how will we find out the total

See here each person has 10 chances look here I am making 10 look here

For one carefully here

See how many choices each has 10 choices have 10 choices so look here the first passenger

has 10 look here I am making 10 the second one also has 10 on the third also 10 on the fourth also neither on the fifth nor on the sixth nor on the seventh

right so we have ten 10 10 no

how much has it come to the power of 10 seven yes for mechanical

also it has come to the power of 10 now it has said no two passenger of the same floor So what does same floor mean that no person should get down on the same floor. So it means that permutation should be done and different items should be taken at a time. Right, what have we done? We have A floors here. Look, if we have seven people, look carefully here. If we have seven people, how many options will the first person have? 10 options. He can move anywhere on any lift. The second person has nine, eight, seven, six and five. Understand? The first person has 10, then nine. Then eight, then seven, then six, then five and then four. Clear. Or what can we call this? Out of 10 floors, we have chosen seven. So what has happened to us? It has become favourable. How did it become favourable? And in detail, understand if the first person has chosen A, then how many options will the person B have left? Look carefully here. If the first person has chosen A, then how many options will the person B have? Nine. Look carefully here. If the first person has chosen A, then how many options will the person B have? There are 10 options, then B
on C 8 on D 7 on E
on 6 on F 5 on G
on 4 clear, it means what should we do now, if we do all these tasks together then 10 in 9 in 8
in 7 in in 6 in 5 in 4 or do it like this 10 p
7 see carefully how much you got from 10 p
everyone is clear, everyone is clear how much you got from 10 p so what was our answer from 10 p
or if you could not do it like this and some smart
children are there then do it like this, see this is also correct 107 in 7 fool this is also correct, see carefully
this is also correct this is also correct this is also correct, all three are correct, see carefully
all these three are correct, first is correct, second is correct, third
correct, if everyone has understood then give us a little answer on chat rate, all children
all things are same, you can do it like this This is the fundamental principle of counting. This is
permutation. There are different ways of looking at combinations.
Everything is clear to everyone. If this much is clear, then we will move ahead. Do the most important thing. Demonstrate it. If n balls are giving a break, then
n balls are randomly selected into n cells. What is the probability that each cell
will be occupied? Demonstrate it quickly.
N balls

s

it is we have just done it with n balls if you are not able to do it then your brain is Faran is correct Utkarsh is correct and n cell

is taken all at time so what to do see what is the probability

Ia factorial power of a because every box has

how many options every ball has

A a

nn how many options will n balls have

power of a is absolutely correct for all children so understand how will you do general

it is clear tell this thing to everyone quickly this much is clear to everyone if this much is clear then I will move forward towards the question now and get it done yaar son

there is still a lot of work yaar

this has to be done in homework and we have to write the answer on telegram this has to be done in homework yes if a was of different balls then there would be absolutely n

factorial multiply a factorial also this has to be done at home its answer

will write what is a factorial

you can come home comfortably But do it, we are doing the Bez theorem, we are doing everything, that's why

Now let's see

We will move ahead, give a break

Give a break, give a break, how many minutes of break should I give you

Tell me, how many minutes of break should I give you [Prashansa]

It's not my wish, you guys tell me, we go by your wish these days

Master's wish is a different thing
15 minutes is fine, you guys will come after 15 minutes, okay, 30

minutes cannot be done, I will give you a break of 10 minutes

Yes, there is a break of 10 minutes, you guys come, okay, no problem

Putin, everyone open your laptops and go, the class is stopped, okay, yes, come

You come in 10 to 15 minutes, I can understand because probability is such a topic in which a lot of brain is used, right

Okay, now we will meet you after 10 minutes

Don't stop, the live is going on, just stop the sound

of it

Hello everyone

Come again all the children

Hello everyone again tell me once on the chat box whether the audio and video quality
is coming fine or not. All the children write on the chat box once whether the audio and video
is correct or not. Let me explain. Sumesh explains. Don't worry, first of all, come

it's awesome. Absolutely very

good, very good. Let's move ahead. We have understood the basics. What is it, what is it not. Now we will see a little ahead. Now we will walk fast. So

we will take care here. Now secondly, we will see that. You have woken up. Very good. So come

all the children. The voice is not coming. Is the voice reaching everyone or

no. Tell me once whether the voice is coming or not. If it is Shashank with replacement, then it

is exactly what we have been doing. Okay, let's go now. Here we will see we have understood the basics we will not waste much time now we will understand classification of events now we will understand classification of events clear so let's start all the children are ready if all the children are ready then tell me once that is why we do not give a break continuity gets broken while giving a break but once all the children write on the chat box let's go let's start we want to see classification of events right we will get the pdf so look here first we will see for two events and then we will see for three events now understand its theory comfortably then let's see one or two questions of it we will move ahead because you will understand from the theory itself so let's see what will happen between for two events and three events so first let's take for two events and when to take it when something is common when something is common then how will we do that we will understand so look here carefully the first rule Here we will always carefully see each rule

When something is common it means what will we get here look here this

is my common event it means what does it mean if this is A

this is B then this A intersection B is clear now if you are asked first here

look probability of both

Akar or probability of A

and B akar clear if this thing is asked to you that

probability till now we were studying for one event now there is more than one event here

but how many events are there more than one and when there is more than one event then what is such an event

called

it is compound event what will such event be called compound event so probability of both akar

or probability of A and B akar the both are similar right then what will be the number

of favourable region or look carefully divide

by total region we have to find this so how

will we find it look A intersection B equals A of A

intersection B upon a this is my probability of both

Akar this came out and what was our total sample point was a so the probability of both happening

If you have to calculate it then you always have to apply this rule and calculate it secondly

If this is asked look carefully understand carefully here right if suppose you are given two events

Let's see here carefully I gave you two events I gave you only one or I gave one a and one f

Look carefully now you have to calculate which portion to find now you are interested in this one look carefully in this portion either you get this or you get this it is the same thing so see what

you will get probability of a and b or

probability of a and b I taught in digital electronics

must have taught you right it is everywhere in the syllabus everywhere if

you don't study here then you will face a lot of problems in future so be careful Listen, if A and B are there then how to find A and B then what will be the number of favourables divided by total then what does favourable mean, if we want to take both these elements then what will be the red element in red, then what will be the union

It will not happen, we have to combine both, this we have taught, so what is A and B

What happened A of A union B

Upon A write A or A union B we break what we got A of

A A of
B B upon A this is here, now what to do separate it

Ok we have done this, look carefully and write on the chat box and tell me if you understood this, so now this

What has become, look here

Probability of A Probability of B minus Probability of A Intersection

B Y has come, this is what we call when something is

common and we have to find the probability, then we have named this as total probability

Theorem for something is common, keep this in mind, this is a very

important thing, it is clear now if we are asked and look

Ahead probability only

What do we have to find probability only A then how will we find only A from only A

First let us see one thing, what are dependent events
So what is the rule for dependent events, we have told it, we are not telling here, we are not going into much detail, what will happen

Probability A intersection B equals P of
A in P of B Ba This has come, look carefully if

we are asked about independent

events then what will be the rule Probability A intersection

B P in P

clearly, if you understood this much, then you have to always remember that if there is a dependent event, then this

will come out, if it is independent, then this will come out, suppose I have for

dependent events A events, we have already taught everything, you just have to revise, right, so what will be made for N events P A B

CD Y has come equal to which P of A P of B Ba A keep doing it like this Pf C

up A intersection, tell me quickly, did you understand, we have done this, all the children got Y and if

if we have to find out for independent events, then what will be made P A intersection B
Intersection C Intersection D What to do with all the probabilities
Multiply them puff A puff B p of
C Look carefully and all the children reply once on the chat box
All the children reply on the chat box Increase the chat rate brother let us know that you are not dead, you are alive So this is the story between our two events If we are asked the probability of A and B then P of A plus P of B minus P of A Intersection B If asked for common then A
Intersection B our n is clear So we have taken out all these things and told you now we
Move forward in that now we see here the probability is only A
Only B needs to be revised once
It is only A only A what does only A mean only one event is happening the other is not happening
So how will we write this we had also taught to write that a worked but B did not work
Right so only a became only What does a mean puff
What does a and only a mean if there are two events then a and b are independent events this is the default if it is not written anywhere then assume this
If you understand then how much puff was made in a in p of b times then how much did p of a come into v minus p of b comes out clear now if you assume he asks further what else can he ask see probability only b then what will happen p of b worked but a did not work then what is the rule of this see p of b in p of a times look carefully so what is the rule of this p of b minus p of this comes out look carefully this
We have taken out all these three things only a only now let us make a diagram of this which you have to remember always in your life see what is the diagram understand here carefully we have total two events right there are two events what is the meaning of two events see here one event a
and the second event is B. This is right. If one event is A, then either A will happen or
A will not happen. This will happen. B will either happen or it will not happen. So
total number of events we have four. See how many events we have? A intersection B A intersection B times
intersection B and A times B times this is what is created. So
from here we can create four events. See, this will happen, will it not happen. A will not happen. A will not happen.
This is clear. Now see the first event. What is created? Combine both of them.
Let us name it both. We named it only.
A. Remember the techniques of remembering like this. We named it only B. We named it neither.
A nor B. All the events are here. Look carefully, it is visible.
It is clear. Now see, if we add both of them. Look, I am looking here.
Carefully, if I add this event and this pink coloured event that we have written,
If you add both of them, what will you get?
You will get it. Exactly
one Exactly one what will be p of a intersection b times plus p a times

Intersection b this is called

Oh no problem no problem

To be clear if I add these two then what will be the probability of

at least one so here we can write probability

of exactly one is equivalent to probability a a

intersection b times plus p b intersection

A is clear, everyone understood, I have told this much

Rajveer corrected, everyone understood this much, it means we are getting to know here

But if there will be the condition of exactly one then what do we have to do, add these two so

Now tell me everyone understood about two events, if event two is given then no one has any

problem Sutar ji Banerjee ji
Pranjal everyone understood, if exactly one will be talked about then also we will take it out, if two numbers will be talked about then
Even then we will take it out, neither A nor B will be talked about, even then we will take it out clearly

Now let us move forward, what will happen for the for three events

See
For three

iii events listen carefully here three events have come now what do we have to do look at A B C something is common this thing is to be kept in mind there is confusion in this but now it should not happen we have taught many times the same things look here if something is talking about this common that one event this happened second event happened second event happened we take this one clear third event look at the third event how many have we got this one we have three events total so look here carefully this A this B and this C clear if we look in these two then which portion is this of ours look I am doing this pink which is yellow look carefully I am doing this yellow portion look at it carefully look at it carefully what will this portion be called A section C look carefully move forward what will this portion be called B intersection C clear here both are happening next session

What will it be called? Look, this one is a intersection b and there is an event here which is common in the sum. Write down that common event. So which one is common? Look carefully, that one is common to you.

This pink event. Look, what is this pink portion?

It is common in all three. It means that we can find out the common one in all three. Let's be clear. So now three events are being formed. So first find out what their union will be. So look, here the probability is a union b union c. Find out this first.

What does it mean? Probability of a, a, b, a, c.

A, b, c. So what will it become?

Look, its formula is better to remember its formula. You people have been studying since childhood. So what is the formula?

Probability of a, Probability of b, Probability of c, Minus probability of a, of a, B, Minus probability of b, or c. Minus probability of c, or a, or plus.

Probability of a, b, c. It came out

It means if all the three events are happening in a, we added them later, then this

formula of ours is the probability of

air, let us write down the formula of

air a and b and c, if we look carefully in this, oh sorry sorry sorry sorry sorry sorry child sorry one second one second write it here

intersection is b sorry clear, so what should we do now look here

carefully no problem we have done it, okay now look here carefully if you

count the events, then how many events are being formed, look here, the event is being formed

one two three four five see the way to catch it six and seven total we have seven events

what is being formed seven events are being formed, total do the intersection in all, how many

are being formed seven are being formed, total seven right now let us find this seven, see how here understand

where did these seven events come from, so we have three events one is a one is b one C

I have three events. Now look carefully here. A

either will happen or it will not happen. B

either will happen or it will not happen. C

either will happen or it will not happen. These will be the ones. So now look carefully. Look, it has two ways. I remembered my old maths which I just studied. It also has two ways. Right, how many events should be formed? Three

in 2 * 2 * 2 equals 2 to the power of 3 equals 8. How many events will be formed in total? 8 events. Now we have to find out which are the events. Look carefully here. You don't have to read anything. Go home and then A

will happen. A will not happen. Look carefully. B

will happen. B will not happen. B will not happen. Look carefully. Methods of making C. What is C? Will it happen or it will not happen. C

will it happen or it will not happen. C

will it happen or it will not happen. Apart from this, look, this is also confirmed. It is assumed that A B C R and we go bye.

The default is independent event. This is also known.

Something is common. We have come to know all these things.

Right, I don't know how long this will last. Look, till then look here. Now how will we do it? If these three work together, what is formed? A intersection B intersection is formed. This means what happened? A is also occurring, B is also occurring and C is also occurring. So, this will be found. Some questions will come. This question can come in total eight ways. Apart from this, more questions will not come. What is formed next? A, B and C times. What does this mean? Look, this means which event is this. Look, now we keep showing you in the diagram. Look carefully. Look carefully here. You will understand in one go. This is A. This is B. This is C. So, now what have we found out? A and B worked but C did not work. A and B worked but C did not work. So, which one is this? Sorry, which one is this? A and B worked but C did not work. What is this? A and B worked but C did not work. Look carefully A and B worked but C did not work. What does this mean? A and B are coming together but not C. Did you understand? Let's see next. What is next? Next is A intersection B times intersection C. This means that A and C worked. So where will A and C work here? Look, this is what will happen. Look carefully. Come next. A B times C times A did not work. C. A worked. B did not work. C did not work. What does this mean? A worked. B did not work. C did not work. So what does this mean? Look carefully. Only A. This is what happened. All children write in the chat box. This is only A. Write this. B. Look carefully. If you understand, please tell us. This is only C. All children see. Only A only B only. C. Now here. But make it this time, now everyone has understood

meaning what is the third event, neither A nor B nor C, I understood
I understood it soon

y say neither a nor b nor c all the events have come look carefully if we add seven to them look what will we get respect a and b and look carefully I will order coffee till then tell me quickly everyone understood it write once on the chat box all the children are clear everyone let's move ahead now let's see what is base theorem see first read till base theorem now let's see what is conditional probability conditional probability see what we have told here probability a given b what does it mean happened b already a and a by b are lying here so what will be its formula look p a intersection b upon p of p means find the probability first of the common and divide it by the total so one of its formula can also be this look a of intersection b see something In the book it is written like this, upon A B upon A A so what is the answer A intersection B upon A this will also be that
It is not clear if you understood this much then what will be the conditional
probability this is what we call P B always not equal to zero if you understood then always remember that whenever you come to find the conditional probability then now you can do
eli like and
What will be this P of A is clear so what is it
Look here it has come what do we call these two
conditional probability and relative
probability everyone understood and P B will never be zero here A
will never be zero and P will never be zero it is the same thing it is clear this much if
you understood this much then you must have come to know how conditional probability works did you understand it quickly
tell if you have understood then all the children a little bit
Tell me let's move ahead what happens if you drink coffee I don't know it's clear it came out

What is our basically conditional now let's see total probability theorem for dependent event

It's so clear let's move ahead now let's see total probability theorem for dependent events

Oh, if the joint has come now then friend

Vaibhav, has the joint come now

I don't know what you read friend I don't understand it at all, maybe it seems to me that it makes absolutely no sense

Is there no sense right now you were hanging there you were not able to understand the sum of two devices two dice and now you are asking about the further

thing joint probability

Tell me let's see here now let's understand for dependent event yes right now there was not able to understand the sum of dice it was clear yes it may be possible I have guessed it and seen total probability theorem for dependent

Look here we have e2
I have n events, right now see what does n events mean here,

look how to do it here, we have to understand a little bit with the help of a diagram,

we will start, let's see carefully here, there are many events,

and two even here, look what is there, we have it, look carefully e3
we have total one event here, listen carefully to this thing, right and he has

said that all these events are interconnected with some event, how do you see here, suppose

I have total, look here, I have total n events, I have to make this figure in my mind,

e2 e3 e4 and all these events are independent, clear, everyone can see, people can also see it, okay, you don't know what is in your syllabus and a sample space connected with all these

events, what is it, we have a sample space, right, which is interconnected with all the events, if we

pay attention If you see, this one has become the first common one. Look carefully between V and A. This one has become the second one. And in between this one has become the third one. This one has become the fourth one. Look carefully, this one is common in all of them. Right, this means that there is a common event attached to all of them, which I have named as Target A. Now I am asking you to tell the probability of this target. How? Now look, suppose you have a number of affected persons which is 200, in which even 20 are there, in T 30 are there. There is something else in e3, something else in e4, something else in e5, something else in I. Now I want to ask that of all these affected persons or all these things, whose probability do we want to find out? Whose target is it? So, how will the probability of the target be found? Probability of target. Till I have the power, you people keep reading here and do not ask unnecessary questions here.

Look Sunny, I don't know your answer, so please leave and go. I don't have any idea. So, I have to calculate the probability of the target. See here, assume the probability of one. We have taught everything. Assume the probability of e2. Assume the probability of e3. And assume the probability of

right, now see, the target will be there later. So this has already happened. What has happened has gone into the divide. What has happened will go into the divide. What has happened will go into the divide. This means that now what do we have to take here? We have to calculate the probability of a. So, how will we get it? See, multiply this. Add this. What do we call this? I will remove this. Don't worry. Why are you worried? I will remove this much. Sunny. Don't you people worry. Okay. What has come out? Total. Probability clear. What has come out? Total We have found the probability of dependent events. Now let us see here what will be the Bayes theorem. Look here carefully. One second. Children, wait children, let us add some slides. Wait for two minutes. You stay on the line for two minutes.


Add id, add slide

No, do it, wait for a minute

It's okay, come here, yes, this one

Do it for a minute, wait for a minute

Go down to the last one

How do I know, you don't have to do it, if it's not there, I'll tell you one more time

Two minutes, two minutes

This is the last

Wait, wait, friend, the technical in-charge has come, tell me

Here, is it done, the bud bot has frozen, I think

the class will have to be cancelled, I'm telling you the truth, I've checked all this, whatever you're checking, I've done all this, save the PDF once and do it again

Will it take a lot of time or how much

Right, not five minutes, at least 15

minutes

By the way, how much is the need, I've done 200 marathons of this, you have done it, but if you could have done it

Why are you taking it here, wait, it's done brother

Uncle
Copy here, is it not happening, copying is happening

Friend, yes You increase it a lot, wait, where do you want to go, this is what you have to do, copy it, go, let's go, start now, the class is getting delayed, let's go, the voice is coming, tell me once, chat once on the chat box, show it, no problem, water is not coming out of the fire, here, look, look, finish carefully, tata bye bye, no, now look, this is our total probability, what does it mean, if we have a total probability, then what can we do now, here we will connect the base theorem with it, see how, understand carefully here one of the most important concepts, then we will jump to the random variable, just after the base theorem, because if you do all this, you guys will not get time to run for the random variable, so after this we will jump to the random variable, so listen carefully, now what does the base theorem say, look here, our base theorem is finding the average probability What do we do with this

Let's find the

Everse probability How to find the

Everse probability here

Look here, let's understand here, look what we did

To make this, we did the same thing here, look carefully

Start Now we have to find the

Everse What do we have to find out Look carefully this is

When

e2

e3 Clear Now see how do we find the

Everse

Probability What is the rule

Look now look carefully here What is this probability

Of probability of Look carefully I am going a little past because

Many things are still left or it has come right, have we taken this, right yes Satish

Anyway we can do it now We will also write the shortcut a

Upon a upon

Now what do we have to find out We have to find out that the target e already happened and then means we have to find out

What do we call this the everse rule, means a has already happened here

Look carefully already
happened and even upon a
happening yay a has already happened and even upon a is going to happen basically this is it so what is it
look here carefully
we have to find this out so how will we get it here see this is my favourite outcome son
what did we name it favourite outcome see which outcome is it of mine
favourable divided by the total so what is it, look favourable
meaning
all the children reply on the chat box what do we call this base
theorem what do we call this base theorem what do we call this base
theorem what does base theorem mean basically such a phenomenon is happening that
the target has already happened and even upon a is going to happen did you understand so now
let's make a shortcut for it see what will be the shortcut wait a second friend what is it happening
brother what will be the shortcut for it see
start now I will make shortcuts for all see how remember
Keep looking here carefully, do nothing, just fit a diagram in your mind, just right clear how will we do it, okay let's see here this is our A, then how will it turn out, this is ov, this is t, this is
e3 this is alpha, this is beta, this is gamma, this is delta, suppose here A is B, this is C, the probability of all these has been given, now if you are asked, look at the probability of your A, then what will happen, the favorable divide total, look carefully, this will happen, if we take theta, then machine learning will become clear, now suppose I take e2 up A, what will become BB, beta this is clear, we can do it like this, it is easily clear and if we have to find the total, what will become the total probability, look at A alpha plus B beta B, plus see, what do we call this, it is clear, everyone, reply me once on the chat box, everyone

Children will teach, we will not teach today because there are many topics which are very
long process, probability takes a lot of time, whatever happens, it will happen as long as we have the capability, it will be done by then, okay, it is clear, base theorem is very
sufficient, so if everyone has understood this much, then we will move forward towards random variable, it is clear to everyone,
for this we have got many questions done, you do not need to do any here, I have taught you in paid batch also, so it is more than sufficient for base theorem and total probability law, now we move towards random variable which is our main motto, so look here, now we study random variable here and
finish it by 5 o'clock, in this we will see many questions, now we understand random variable, that too which uni
variate means one dimension
Let's understand here, yes I am telling you Moinuddin

Don't take tension I am telling you, when you give the paper you will understand, then to process it clearly

You will have to give leave then your mind will process it, this much is understood as random variable

First of all


So we will write the main points because we are not able to explain it completely because time is very less here. Firstly, the first important point is random variable is a mathematical function. What is this? It is a mathematical function. It means if I do f true that x mapping. This will be the definition of the function. So here what is x sample point and what is the probability or unique value here. This is our right. Okay Gaurav, we will put this. So we have understood that a mathematical function is how it works. We have explained all the things to you. Second most important point is here. Look here, how do we understand here? We can understand it through a table. Look here, what do we do? We make a table. This is x1, x2, this is x. This is the first one given p1, p2, p3, p. We call this table as probability mass table. This table has to be kept clear in mind. Let us ask questions. We will ask at least many questions. And Tia Jaiswal ji has asked questions. She has asked many questions. You might not have asked so many questions anywhere. So wait a little. Right. Thirdly, let us understand that the total probability will be equal to one. Meaning equal to one. Clearly, don't worry. Fourthly, see what is the CDF. It will be the Cullet distribution. Are there more questions of this function? Do you remember the formula? Remember the formula? Make it clear. Firstly, this is a monotonically increasing function. Second, the value of minus infinity is zero. The value of plus infinity is one. Clearly, I understood this much. Now, let us move ahead. Let us understand further. This is monotonically increasing. This is its lower value. This is its upper value. Clearly, this much is clear. Now you have understood both these things. Is this a ladder function or a staircase function? It is clear. We have told you everything. So CDF will always be a step function. You will understand more if you ask more questions. Now let us see what a right PDF is. We have understood this. Now move ahead. Now let us see here. One second, this is creating a big mess. There is no one here. Now see what we have seen. And what are the types of random variables? Everything has been taught. All of them have been detailed. So you can understand. And now there is no need to do much detailing. We have already detailed the fundamentals because that is needed a lot. So what are the types of random variables? There are two types of random variables. One is our discrete which we call countable and the other is our continuous. We call it measurable. So there are two types of things. One is countable. One is uncountable, we have mentioned both these things, one is discrete random variable and one is continuous random variable, so for discrete some things will be different, for continuous some things will be different, so let's see here, now look here, if I am talking about discrete random variable, try to understand this carefully, maybe you will remember everything, if I talk about discrete random variable, then it will always be in integer, its value will be in integer only, it can only be determined on integer and whenever we talk about discrete, then it will always talk about arrival pattern, it will talk about arrival pattern and its value will always be in integer, when the value is in integer then it will always be a discrete random variable, right, what will be its properties, first of all, see, what will be the sum of all the probabilities equal to One equals one in discrete right probability of arrival pattern arrival has to be seen arrival means right for integer value this first property is done second look in this we will always make mass functions for integer value this much is clear and when it will be continuous look here attention before this revision was going on in one only it was not possible to do all three in four hours so we said let me get it done in two so we said let me get it done on Sunday itself so what will be continuous random variable everybody knows from A to B f x d x what will be equal to one why because continuous random variable everybody knows defined on interval on what is defined if interval is defined then given interval will be given x here what is continuous random way understood so what will be A to B AD x equal to one or or what will be minus Infinity two plus

Infinity is clear, this much is there, apart from this there is one more

What do we call this f one, everybody knows the probability density

The function is clear, so now what is the rule

See what is equal to f one, look carefully this is the most important link

If we find the CDF of any continuous random variable, any random variable,

Differentiable

What will we get, we will get the PDF, this property has to be remembered always, so what will f x

x be equal to

Whatever reason is given is clear to everyone

So much we have seen the parameters for both continuous and discrete

Do questions, this much is more than sufficient to explain now, then we will see further, now let's move ahead, let's do questions quickly

Say data science, let's do questions and show

Wait a second, friend, here there is some mess in the file because there is too much file

Do it, do it, question number one

Do it quickly, I will say yes, let's find the PDF

of
X and its distribution function is given

Look, I have written all the children

Do

This distribution function is given

Do it, do it, all the children do it

Show it Rahul Sir, PW do it Ashmin Chakraborty is right

Let yours do it and the children

are right and you be mine

What did you do, tell me what did you people

do, just why

Difference, see here, what have we told, we have to find the PDF, then how

will we get it

This is how we will get the PDF, see, let us take out the derivative

If it comes out, what will be the PDF

Created and for other wise

Zero, understand what do we call this function, read it carefully

See the uniform distribution carefully

It is clear to all, come next, come next, now keep watching son, there is a lot to be done

So, there is a lot to be done

Do it Vaidya sahab, do this one quickly and show

There are many more to be done

Ask questions, do it, keep doing

Whatever happens now
Do it

Lada export minus Lada Expo Asian is right, all the children

do it

Don't make me do it, you guys will do it yourself

It will be more beneficial, let me tell you, if all the children say, then I

will tell you, I will do it and show you

The question is nothing to do, look here, look carefully

Probability x greater than equal x is given here

Look, this is given, if this is not given, then

we will find out this CDF, what is this, this is our probability

given one, look carefully, how will we do it, look here

Nothing to do, it is a very simple task, don't do anything, it is very simple

Look, we know what CDF is, look here carefully, just use a little bit of

mind here, this is what we need, look here, brother has come, now what will we do, look

we have to find out this, if this is there, then we will get it, what

we can do, look carefully

From here

Look clear, how much is given here

Look carefully, now it is clear, now what have we learned

Change this zero, now its differentiable

two has come, look what

It is found, everyone has nothing to do, if you have been given a CDF, then you can easily

get the PDF, it is fine, come to the next question

Come on, do the question

Next, hey, Data Science has not said this, friend, you are giving the answer anyway, tell me one thing,

What is the definition of CDF, son, Data Science ji, here

Look, to get the CDF, you need this, right, then how

will you get it, you must have understood, you must have

cleared it, next

Look, do it quickly

Now, now see, what is given, tell me, I have told you, friend, now this is

given, look here and you have to find the F, do it,

I have given you 10 minutes, do it, it is something like this No, if you are not able to understand this, then either you do not know the difference, it is a very simple maths, I have told you that if you have this given and you have to find it, then I have told you in a simple way, now if you are not able to understand this, then go and read the fundamentals a little bit, now we have asked you what is this, now this is given and this has been asked, now I am asking you to find this and f is given, do it and the ratio is wrong, find it again, A2 is correct, Arish Man Chakraborty, you have also found it wrong, do it quickly, yes, do the integration and show me, I will write it now, do it, I do not know, you people do it, show me, everyone is wrong, find it, so many questions have been given like this, it is coming, look at it once, Chakraborty, otherwise I will tell you, I will do it, then if there is no ratio, then it is fine, then no ratio is correct, it is fine, Mohammad, do it, then I have told you, find the CDF, what about it

It will come

Okay, let's see what is coming now, wait, if you want to find out a, then see f is given

What have we told that the total between a and b

What will be equal to one, so let's do it here, see how

How do you do it, Shita ji

Brother two is coming, it's good, let's see now

Let's see x square batu so 1

Upt
How much a came, see how much a will come

Are you guys not doing batu plus
a 9/4

How much will y come one second 9 batu 45 and two

Two and a half minus

2.5a okay

Now let's see how much is coming

It should come a2 son a2 is coming

It will come equal to a, everyone calculate once, carefully

It is how much will it come one second, it will become 4a

A batu equals batu A equals 1 batu is coming

It is not batu
It will come, it has come 1 Baatu now try to find out f of this, all the children, then how will f be found out

See if a is equal to 1/2, now write f with one, what

Now there is nothing to do, just integrate, we are teaching a

Ax all the children will do ax a - 3a

Ps - ax3 -
ax3 go ahead

0 do it, now tell me quickly how will you do it

Now do it and tell me, use your brain, what will you have to do, now see, you have to use your brain like this, you have to memorize

No, look here, what is d upd one equal to f one

This is f one, this is it, now what has been given to you, you have to find this, then what will be this

Look here
Find out quickly, all the children, by 5 o'clock, okay, we will leave you at 5 o'clock

Let's first look here, do this

Okay, now just keep integrating

Now you have to find out the first one, this one, so how to find it

First look here, this is what I am doing, how much is a

Come, we have to integrate this, nothing else to do

Is Just integrate between zero to one, what is the first one coming out, all the children should tell what are you getting from the first one, what will come from the second one, look 1 is 1, we have to integrate it, integrate it, we will integrate, everyone is right, everyone just has to integrate from one to two, everyone will integrate, then what will come out, you will understand, the probability density function will be formed, you just have to integrate, you understood, you will do it, one or two more questions, tell me quickly, one

Two more questions are given, let's do this at home, don't waste time here, there is a lot of work left, we will do this at home, see HW, see carefully, it will not be finished today, we will plan for some other day, we will tell you right now, I am not able to do anything quickly, if you people are studying then you know, no problem, do as much as you can, this question will be done, see, it means otherwise, all these questions are ours, very old, we will do a session on telegram now, so do it comfortably, it is nest work, we will take some things forward, come, do this, we will give you practice, yes, you can absolutely do it, let's do it and show it, it will be done, do it quickly, I will do it, first you do it, tell me its PMF, everything is taught to you, you have done all the revision, tell me and take it out quickly. If you just tell the value of theta then from zero to one

f will be one given, look no problem here

look upon x factorial

here what is the factorial in other wise zero here look carefully

what is given in other wise zero so how to do it look carefully here nothing

to do is to make its PMF so what will have to be done to make PMF look very

simple very simple what to do first of all we know this thing here

look PMf will be made only

when from a to

bfxx2 infa clear one is given right from c theta's power x upon

factorial or we can do this we sum them up its sum

will be equal to one

clearly this much understood now we don't have to do anything to find its summation

if so take c out clear I took c out you

what to do look now let's start doing from here theta's power one factorial

one Whose is equal to one? Yes, this is a series for discrete. Now the power of x is not an expansion. There should be one more in the power of e. Look, if there is no one, then we added one and sub-cut it. Because what is the series of power theta? What will be the series? Plus theta. Hey, first look as much as it is. Easy. So what will be the series? Power theta of e. Find the value of e. Look carefully. Hey, minus and is formed. Look here. This is why the series is such. It does not start from zero. It starts from one. Son, one is less. One. It is clear. We understood. Yes, it is a simple math. It is not like that. So, our value of c is found. Theta is found. It will remain between zero and one. Look carefully. Let's move ahead. Let's not waste time. Let's move ahead. All the children should do this question. Total whole question. Do it on your copy. 5 minutes time starts. Now hurry up. If you understand this question, then many other things will be understood automatically. Do it. All the children, do it. I will move aside. Do it. Everything is there in it, son. Everything is there in it. Whatever is left, we will not do much. We will teach it later. But tomorrow it will be linear algebra. Whatever is left today, we will study it later. There is no issue. First you do it. Do it. There are different questions. Do it. When all your sessions are over, we will do it later. Okay. I don't know when the class is, let's see. Now, yes, keep doing it. When we will write the answer, then check and tell us. Do it. How can we wind up at 6 o'clock? Understand that my mind also has a length. Understand that if I am speaking with continuous energy for five hours, then the class will be effective. It does not happen, so if we do it again, it will be better and we will do it right now as soon as we finish linear algebra calculus, we will hold your class any day, okay, don't be so worried, all the children know, the first one is 1, I am writing its answer, the first I is 1, the answer of B is /, the answer of C is 1, the answer of D is not Ba, no, the answer of D is not Ba, the answer of E is zero, the answer of D is not Bath, everyone check it, children, I take the class comfortably, I am not in such a hurry, the children who have studied with us in data science know this, we believe that the more you understand, the better it is, check everyone's answer, 1, 1/6, 1, 1, 0 and 1/3, look, pay attention

To

matched, the same amount should be done. So

the CDF is CDF here write f one.

Let me tell you right now Ankit, I am telling you right now.

Let the children do it first.

Come on, let me tell you this question. Look here, I will tell you this question.

Understand, all the children see, this is the distribution function given to us. Look carefully, this is given. I will write it once.

0 x by f 1 by x by 12 by 1 0 zero by

Nine by two. Look carefully. This type of question was also given in DPP. Look, how will we do it here? Look carefully. First of all, we have to find out what is x less than two. What does x less than two mean? Look here, what is the probability of less than two? All the children tell me, look carefully. How much probability x less than two is visible? Look carefully, 1 by two.

Clear, clear, now look ahead. If you

It is being asked that probability x i 2 so tell me how will you do it

probability x i 2 some child

tells

So there is nothing to do here look at this probability, if we subtract this

probability from this probability then what should we do this is u plus

minus it look at the probability of minus look carefully

now we have been given 2 plus

minus it turn it into minus

probe

Clear the ability, nothing to do

If you want to clear the ability, then how much did you get, keep it on two, then put two in place of x

How much did you get out, you can do it by taking it out and it is easy

If you understand, then you will do all the questions in this way, now suppose this has been asked, see

Third, tell from one to i, now how will you do from one to i, then

Take minus, take minus, that means before th

Tell from one to minus how much will come, then how much will you get, take the one before batu

And take that of one, take the one before one

Do exple 3 like this

It will come out

Easily, all the children tell honestly, then you have to approach this question at home, if you do not make it, then we will take help from us on Tegra

Right clear, do not be tensed, relax, stay happy

There is no need to take too much tension, stay happy, stay fit comfortably and stay happy, do this one, let's check the weather Following function R

Check if there is distribution or not, all these will come, right now you are enjoying

Yes Rathore and all this is there now, you can see later friend, are you Rathore or Tiwari ji or
Tripathi ji, I am saying you are Lord Bobby Abhay Singh

Yes you are Lord

Bobby do it, this is Lord Bobby, brother Abhay will tell this

Do it slowly, do this question and show

I am not getting marks in the test series, such questions come, simple, is this a distribution function or not, tell me quickly Lord

Bobby ji, very good, how did you find out, tell me

Anshul, how did you find out, tell me quickly Anshul

[Music] Tell me quickly, all the children, all of you check

People, let's see how we will do it here, let's understand here, let's leave it, I will explain here

Look, we have this, I will decide and tell you here

Look, we have this, so what do we have to do, let's draw its graph

How will its graph be made

This It is zero, it is 1/2

How much is this and how much is this ahead, there is one ahead and what is in between this

is your number, this is your number, see the graph, this is our number, and here x is coming, see 0 two

what is in between the number x and if one is greater than x, then what

is our graph, it is clear no one can hack the network, if we are not such big hackers, then we must have done it from outside, we must not have done it here, this has come, now see what should we do now, now he said

is this distribution function valid and if it is not, then you do not have to think much in this, what do you have to think, see, first of all check

is it a non-negative function or not, tell me quickly, all

children, is this a non-negative function or not, quickly

tell me, this is a non-negative function and not first

done second is it greater than equal zero or

no yes, what will be its probability, greater than zero, apart from this if
If we see, what is f minus infinity, what is zero f plus infinity,
No, this means this right CDF is valid,
All the children will do CDF,
So there is nothing to do in PDF and CDF, just simply, if there is PDF, then integration,
If there is CDF, then
Differential, valid CDF for all, valid PDF means this, it implies,
Absolutely, if there is valid CDF, then there will be valid PDF also, only then this principle will be very clear, let's move ahead one or two and see, now do this at home,
H is double and come, H W, you have to make its CDF at home comfortably,
See it is clear, these are for home,
All CDFs have to be made and PDFs, both CDFs are made, nest,
Work is clear, see more, see, wait for now,
Brother, we have taken simple questions so that your understanding becomes good, friend,
Our job is to understand this So let me tell you guys did you understand CDF and PDF, what is it, no no it will not happen tomorrow, if it happens then it will happen in the last, if it is this much topic then it will happen, it will not happen in the middle, tomorrow linear algebra and calculus will be a small topic, both of them will be dealt with together, my hairstyle is good, ok, let's move ahead, now we have seen CDF and PDF here, now let's understand here, some statistics tomorrow, averages here, look here carefully, I am not sending it right now, I am taking the class right now, I will go now, right, let's understand here, carefully some statistics tomorrow, averages, so what is the first thing, expectation, look here carefully, what does expectation mean, tomorrow we will tell you unsullied expectation, what does expectation mean, expectation means this, aa equal to a x a p, what do we call this, mean, what do we call this, expected value similar

Thinking this I called x and sometimes some books refer to me right

It is clear that we call it x or some books refer to me and we will proceed like this

Let's call it variance

What is variance? It will take out the error that comes in chance in probability

So what will be the variance

A x a square pi

Minus x i pi hole

Square A rat has entered the bag, you also go inside to that rat so here

See what has been formed a x

Square minus x hole square what will we call this

Variance we have to pay attention very carefully right see next

Let's see standard deviation what is standard deviation

Here look under root

of variance this much is understood

Now it is clear so these three are very important

properties it is very simple to say it is very simple on their base the whole statistics rests

So we have to understand very carefully its meaning For a discrete random variable, the statistical averages will be something else and for a continuous random variable, the statistical averages will be something else. So let's see a diagram here.

I make a gram

Look here then we remind all the properties

I have written this for discrete and I have written this for continuous

So what will be the result for discrete, let's see here

First

What will be the expectation for discrete aa equal to a x aa p means x equal to

What happened xv pv ext

p2 x p this is called a

It is clear, this is it, what will be the expectation for continuous

See, integration will be used in this so do a to b x f one by one, look carefully at the formula

All this is it, this is the formula for expectation, if we assume a and b limits are not given

It is

Limit a and b are not given then what will you use minus infinity to plus

infinity, it is clear, let's move ahead

Expectation is done and let's see

Now what will be the variance a x
square Whole square of x is clear now what will be the variance from here
The formula has been applied
Just clear now if someone asks about standard deviation
For this then this will happen same for this also
It will be clear all
All the children should respond on the chat box
Fast it is clear let's move ahead now let's see some more some property is about
Expectation this is probability son it doesn't get revised so quickly it takes a lot of time everything is a deception
Look in this here let's understand brother Feri Cheri Kachhi Carry Britney
Perry whatever it is you guys please be a little serious please please be serious please see here some properties about expectation so here
Let's see the first property property number one if xv
Ext x3 x f x a
R N independent random variable
Clear now what should be done to everyone add all of them
We have to do it so listen carefully xv
Ext eks3 Tomorrow the session will be over soon Tomorrow's session will take very little time It takes a lot of time son, there is nothing in tomorrow's session It will be over very soon I understood that if we have different expectations then we can add everyone, it is clear, I will give you tea to drink, I will bring tea right now, look next, if I say e
of a x p b then don't do anything, take a out e of x ps right and look if someone asks, of x square is not equal to x square this will not happen right I understood, look here brother, all the people, my friends, children are not studying, so what should I do, tell me, you are also not studying, you are busy with your message, look here it has come, if I say e1 up x is not equal 1
If I am saying e1 up x s, it does not mean
e x s. Now I understood this much.
These are basically some properties which you have to remember always. And now let us see something about variance. So what if the variance becomes negative x
What will happen if I say variance a x p b. What will happen if I say variance a x p b. What will happen if I say variance a x p b.
Now I understood. Variance is never negative. This has to be kept in mind always. Variance cannot be negative. It is clear that it can never be negative. Right. Now look, let us see one more property which is very important. Let us understand it here. First we will understand one more property. We will do the questions later. Let us understand it first. And look, I have also solved questions related to this in DPP. Look, function of a random variable. Here, listen to me carefully. I will also tell you here if someone asks you the function of random variable. I myself am tired of looking at your comments. Look here, the function of random variable. Now how will we do this? Not x is equivalent to a to b x f one d one. Now listen carefully here. You should read it, friend. Cherry cherry, raw mango, whatever it is, raw kernel, whatever it is, look here now. We have to take the function of random variable. That means this one, in place of this one, we have taken some function. Look carefully, we have taken g one. We have taken i in place of this. How will it happen? Look carefully. This is very simple mathematics. Look carefully here. We have transformed the random variable. We have made a function by taking the points of x in the function. If I make a function by taking them, then what will be formed. Look carefully. Now what will be its expectation? Look carefully, what has been formed? A to B x

In place of g x in f one

in did you understand? did you understand the function of random variable

or you can also call it expectation of random variable

yes, did you understand this much? Everyone has a question. Let us solve that question

right here right now. Look, I will ask you a question here. I have notes. We will understand it carefully.

That's it. If we don't talk about it, you will understand. If you solve our DPP also, then

good. You will definitely get top 100 rank. Let's see here what has been asked. Look, it is objective.

This is the question. Look here, x has exponential distribution with mean theta greater than zero.

So this function has been given. What do you have to find out from it? Find the expectation.

So what concept will be used in this? First look carefully. Function of random variable. This concept will be used.

So see how we can use it.

We will do it, I did not study, brother, the condition will get worse in 10 hours, look here, salute,

People who have 10 hours, how will they do the function of random variable, look here, what is x

This is the exponential distribution, look carefully,

Se V Mean

What is theta given with mean theta so how will you do it yes I know, when I talk to Vijay sir I know that x is an exponential distribution so whenever there is an exponential distribution what will be the parameter in it
if it is lada then what does it mean function will be l to the power minus lda x look here carefully right but what has he given he has given theta parameter so when theta parameter will be given then remember we had written a formula that if you are given the parameter in the form of mean all the children will tell me here what would be the f one of the exponential we would have e to the power minus x our m greater zero m greater zero and this is otherwise remember this formula you remembered what is the mean here is theta so change it in the formula what have we told you that in place of la what have you put here what have you put here now what have you put here Look at theta carefully, what do we do, if theta is clear then we put theta here, minus this is a function in the form of a parameter and it is in the form of m, which means in the form of mean, everyone understood this, you will not be able to understand this before the formula that we have written, if you have not studied then you will not be able to understand, we have solved it in DPP also, so what function did we get, look, we got the function a f a x equal to our theta e to the power minus x by theta th greater zero x greater g and zero on the other way other wise on zero now what do we have to find out eva, what do we have to find out eva, how will we find out eva, look here carefully, not now, look at this question for two minutes, first we have to find out eva and for this we have given eva, what is eva, look at eva given eva x, look carefully this question can come in this
This is given, look carefully, it means that this is basically a function

F or g is the same thing

This means that we will have to apply the maths of the function of random variable here, so if we apply the maths of the function

of random variable, what does the maths say

Look, the maths says that e of va is equal to the function

Va into this, will the function be the same or not? All the children should look

Minus infinity to infinity, the function into this, change it a little

It might seem a little awkward to some people, keep va instead of va, keep g here

Sorry, this is what came, look carefully, everyone once

Respond to me on the chat box at least 20 to 25

Children, hurry up, this is the last question, we will leave it after this, when will we do the next 14

Okay, so don't panic and maximum like head estimator will teach you

Day after tomorrow, okay, recording I will get it inserted just once more

Look here, look here, this function of exponential distribution, son, I have taught it

all this has been told

son, all this has been told

I have told all these things

here, look here, you have not told theta e to the power minus x ba theta

why would you keep any random variable, you don't even read the question, you hire a person to read the question

Anit Ankit, what is this given

look, if exponential distribution is in the form of 1 parameter, then this

happens, I have taught you everything, friend, and if it is in the parameter of mean, then

it will be clear, let's move ahead now, now look here, we have to find out this function, so how will the formula be found, so this is what did we put in place of 2

I accepted this in my mind, what did I accept this in my mind, so that

there is no confusion, right, I will not drink water I will drink after finishing the class then minus
infinity to plus infinity g one f one now what to do look here so where to start from zero
from zero to see here from zero how much
theta right from zero when we are taking theta then how much is our x ba 2 put this g
instead of one put this one into 1 our theta my x
ba theta you people don't see any DPP etc. solution you just keep on shouting group p do this do that do that do that
do that do that 1 up is lada right so here mean
how much is theta given then vo our theta will not be lada
look at the place brother gal trends this has come plus theta to
infinity now where is x greater than theta given see x greater
theta this came
look clear hey we have solved everything in DPP find its answer find this
integration by parts You will apply this at home I am not doing this work, will you get it, I remember the answer, you will get 1 p 2 power minus w in w, look carefully, this will come, it has come, look carefully, why will d be x, friend, say it here, here d is the same, be clear to everyone, now whatever portion is left in this, we will teach you y variate distribution and goodness of fit, when you are done, what is the topic after this, I will tell you everything now, just understand half, finish, now I will teach you, leave this ML etc., for that I will upload the recording video, okay, you will get it on telegram, I will upload it right now, okay, now you will be taught y variate maxima minima, apart from this, distribution theory, it will take very less time, I will not tell you much because it is already explained very well, we will just look at the formulas and after this the last The goodness of fit remains. If you read it a little, there is a possibility that you will have questions tomorrow on Linear Algebra and Calculus. You have to join CSC as well. Bring Linear Algebra and Calculus. Finish both of them on time.

There will be five to six hours

in which we don't have to tell much. We will do very little and will complete all the work in that time. Okay, there will be time from 12 o'clock

so what revision will you do, I will write it down

today random

variable DPP to write apart from this those who don't have notes

can take the complete theory from my group apart from this you have to do

homework till here if you listen to me even a little then do this much homework

you just have to do nothing apart from this much homework class notes only class

notes only class

notes there is no need to read anything new you have been taught a lot in the class itself

if there is no fear then we have really ended it because we don't know about anyone else

we have cured your fear in probability don't know about CN I will have to ask Ankit sir

and Ankit bhai

why will I write

friend why will I write friend why will I give this exam right see next

next what do you have to do in homework

Revise all the distribution theory you have

take it right now we will take up the remaining part when all these sessions are over

after your CS. Okay, we will upload the PDF on telegram right now.

So you have to do distribution theory properly. You have to read it. We will conduct your session in five
