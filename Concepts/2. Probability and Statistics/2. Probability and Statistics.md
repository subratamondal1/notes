- PYQ: Question 24, GATE CSE 2007 - "Suppose we uniformly and randomly select..."
- Suppose we uniformly and randomly select a permutation from the 20! permutations of 1, 2, 3,..., 20. What is the promutations that 2 appears at an earlier position than any other even number in the selected permutation?

**Question:** Suppose we uniformly and randomly select a permutation from the $20!$ permutations of $1, 2, 3, \dots, 20$. What is the probability that $2$ appears at an earlier position than any other even number in the selected permutation?

**Options:**

- A) $\frac{1}{2}$
- B) $\frac{1}{10}$
- C) $\frac{9!}{20!}$
- D) None of the above.
