# Graph Theory
1. **Graph (G = {V, E})**: Consists of vertices **(V)** and edges **(E)**. Used to model relationships between objects.

3. **Vertex (Node)**: Fundamental unit of a graph.

4. **Edge (Link)**: Connection between two vertices.

5. **Directed Graph**: Edges have directions (digraphs), whereas **Undirected Graph**: No direction on edges.
6. **Loops:** A loop starts and ends at the same vertex, such as an edge from vertex A to itself, often denoted as (A,A). In undirected graphs, a loop contributes **2** to the degree of a vertex. This is because each endpoint of the loop is counted separately, even though they’re the same vertex.

7. **Cycle**: Path starting and ending at the same vertex without repeated edges.

8. **Degree of Vertex**: Number of edges incident on a vertex:
   - **In-degree**: Edges directed toward a vertex.
   - **Out-degree**: Edges directed away.

 9. **Tree**: Acyclic connected graph without cycles.

## Types of Graphs
In graph theory, there are various types of graphs, each with distinct structures and characteristics.

### 1. Undirected Graph
   - In an undirected graph, edges have no direction, meaning if there is an edge between vertices $( A )$ and $( B )$, you can travel from $( A )$ to $( B )$ and vice versa.
   - Example: Social networks, where friendships are mutual.

### 2. Directed Graph (Digraph)
   - In a directed graph, each edge has a direction, indicated by an **arrow**. An edge from $( A )$ to $( B )$ means you can travel from $( A )$ to $( B )$, but not the other way unless there’s also an edge from $( B )$ to $( A )$.
   - Example: Twitter, where following someone doesn’t imply mutual following.

### 3. Weighted Graph
   - In a weighted graph, each edge has a weight or cost associated with it. This type is often used to represent distances, costs, or capacities.
   - Example: Road networks, where the weights represent distances between locations.

### 4. **Unweighted Graph**
   - An unweighted graph has edges without any weights or costs. Each edge is considered equal in value.
   - Example: Basic social networks without varying intensities of relationships.

### 5. Simple Graph
   - A simple graph is an **undirected graph with no loops** (edges connecting a vertex to itself) and no multiple edges between any pair of vertices.
   - Example: A simple friendship network where each pair of friends is represented by only one connection.

### 6. Multigraph
   - A multigraph can have **multiple edges (parallel edges)** between the same pair of vertices. Loops may or may not be allowed depending on the specific definition.
   - Example: Transport networks where there may be multiple routes (edges) between two cities (vertices).

### 7. Complete Graph
   - In a complete graph, there is an edge between every pair of vertices. A complete graph with $( n )$ vertices has $( \frac{n(n-1)}{2})$edges.
   - Example: A network where every user is directly connected to every other user.

### 8. Cycle Graph
   - A cycle graph is a connected graph where each vertex has exactly two edges, forming a single closed loop.
   - Example: Circular routes in a transportation system.

### 9. Bipartite Graph
   - A bipartite graph divides vertices into two disjoint sets such that **edges only connect vertices from different sets**, not within the same set.
   - Example: Job assignment problems where one set represents people and the other set represents tasks.

### 10. Planar Graph
   - A planar graph can be drawn on a plane **without any edges crossing each other**. The famous Euler’s formula $( V - E + F = 2 )$ (for vertices $( V )$, edges $( E )$, and faces $( F )$) applies to planar graphs.
   - Example: Road maps or circuit layouts.

### 11. Connected and Disconnected Graphs
   - **Connected Graph**: There is a path between every pair of vertices. The graph forms a single component.
   - **Disconnected Graph**: Contains at least two components that are not connected by any path.
   - Example: Islands in a network where not all nodes are reachable from each other.

### 12. Tree
   - A tree is an acyclic, connected graph. It has $( n )$ vertices and $( n-1 )$edges (where $( n )$ is the number of vertices).
   - Example: File directories on a computer, where each file or folder has only one path from the root directory.

### 13. DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph)
   - A DAG is a directed graph with no cycles. It is used in scenarios where processes must occur in a specific order.
   - Example: Task scheduling where some tasks must be completed before others.

### 14. Subgraph
   - A subgraph is a portion of a graph that includes a subset of its vertices and edges.
   - Example: A smaller section of a social network graph representing a specific friend group.

### 15. Complement of a Graph
   - The complement of a graph $( G )$ is a graph with the same set of vertices but includes an edge between every pair of vertices not connected in $( G )$.
   - Example: In a social network, if $( G )$ represents known connections, the complement would represent unknown or non-existent connections.
## Graph Traversal
### BFS-Queue (Breadth First Search)
**Breadth-First Search (BFS)** is a graph traversal algorithm that explores nodes in a level-wise manner, visiting all neighbors of a node before moving on to the next level of nodes. It’s commonly used in applications requiring the shortest path or minimum steps in an unweighted graph.
### BFS - Queue Algorithm:
Take:
* **Queue:** Root Node
* **Visited:**
1. **Step 1:** "Cross" (cut/remove) the node from the **front of the queue** and **enqueue** its **unvisited** adjacent nodes (children) in **any order**.
2. **Step2:** **Mark the crossed node as visited** by adding it to the visited list.
3. **Repeat**: Continue with steps 1 and 2 for each subsequent node in the queue until all nodes are processed (i.e., the queue becomes empty).
### Graph Structure and Adjacency List
1. **Nodes**: $(A, B, C, D, E, F)$
2. **Edges**: $\text{A-B, A-C, B-D, C-E, D-F}$

3. **Adjacency List**:
   ```
   A: B, C
   B: A, D
   C: A, E
   D: B, F
   E: C
   F: D
   ```

#### Dry Run

1. **Initialize the Queue and Visited List**:
   - **Queue**: $[A]$
   - **Visited**: $\text{[ ]}$

2. **Process Node $A$**:
   - **Cross (dequeue)**: $A$
   - **Enqueue Adjacent Nodes**: $B, C$ (adjacent to $A$)
   - **Mark $A$ as Visited**: $[A]$
   - **Queue**: $[B, C]$

3. **Process Node $B$**:
   - **Cross (dequeue)**: $B$
   - **Enqueue Adjacent Node**: $D$ (adjacent to $B$, but $A$ is already visited)
   - **Mark $B$ as Visited**: $[A, B]$
   - **Queue**: $[C, D]$

4. **Process Node $C$**:
   - **Cross (dequeue)**: $C$
   - **Enqueue Adjacent Node**: $E$ (adjacent to $C$, but $A$ is already visited)
   - **Mark $C$ as Visited**: $[A, B, C]$
   - **Queue**: $[D, E]$

5. **Process Node $D$**:
   - **Cross (dequeue)**: $D$
   - **Enqueue Adjacent Node**: $F$ (adjacent to $D$, but $B$ is already visited)
   - **Mark $D$ as Visited**: $[A, B, C, D]$
   - **Queue**: $[E, F]$

6. **Process Node $E$**:
   - **Cross (dequeue)**: $E$
   - **No New Adjacent Nodes**: $C$ is already visited.
   - **Mark $E$ as Visited**: $[A, B, C, D, E]$
   - **Queue**: $[F]$

7. **Process Node $F$**:
   - **Cross (dequeue)**: $F$
   - **No New Adjacent Nodes**: $D$ is already visited.
   - **Mark $F$ as Visited**: $[A, B, C, D, E, F]$
   - **Queue**: $\text{[ ]}$

#### Final Visited Order
The BFS traversal starting from $A$ yields the following **visited order**: $[A, B, C, D, E, F]$.

### Properties and Applications
1. **Shortest Path**: BFS finds the shortest path in unweighted graphs, making it ideal for navigation, web crawlers, and network routing.
2. **Time Complexity**: $(O(V + E))$ where $( V )$ is the number of nodes, and $( E )$ is the number of edges, because each node and edge is processed once.
3. **Space Complexity**: $(O(V))$ for the queue and visited list.

BFS is useful for tasks like level-order traversal, finding connected components, and determining the minimum moves in scenarios like chess or maze navigation.


Here's a summarized note based on the provided context about BFS (Breadth-First Search) and DFS (Depth-First Search) traversal techniques for graph data structures:

### Graph Traversal Techniques

#### 1. **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**
   - **Definition**: BFS, also called level-order traversal, explores a graph by visiting nodes layer by layer, prioritizing nodes closest to the root before moving deeper.
   - **Process**:
     - Choose any node as the starting (root) node and initiate traversal.
     - **Data Structure**: Queue (FIFO - First In, First Out).
     - Steps:
       - Insert the root node into the queue.
       - Dequeue a node, mark it as visited, and enqueue all unvisited adjacent nodes.
       - Repeat until all nodes are visited.
   - **Key Point**: BFS explores all neighbors of a node before moving to the next level, ensuring all nodes at a given distance from the root are visited before going deeper.
#### 2. **Depth-First Search (DFS)**
   - **Definition**: DFS is a traversal technique that explores each branch of the graph as deeply as possible before backtracking.
   - **Process**:
     - Begin from any root node.
     - **Data Structure**: Stack (LIFO - Last In, First Out).
     - Steps:
       - Push the root node onto the stack and mark it as visited.
       - Select **an unvisited adjacent node (not all adjacent nodes)**, push it onto the stack, and continue until reaching a node with no unvisited neighbors.
       - Backtrack by popping the stack and checking for unvisited nodes until the stack is empty.
   - **Key Point**: DFS dives deeply into each path from the root before backtracking to explore other branches, thus covering the graph thoroughly.

#### BFS vs. DFS Key Differences
   - **Traversal Approach**:
     - BFS: Explores all nodes at the same level before descending.
     - DFS: Explores as far down a branch as possible before backtracking.
   - **Data Structures**:
     - BFS uses a queue for level-by-level traversal.
     - DFS uses a stack for depth-based traversal.

#### Multiple Valid Traversals
   - Both BFS and DFS have numerous valid traversal paths, depending on the order nodes are enqueued (for BFS) or stacked (for DFS).
