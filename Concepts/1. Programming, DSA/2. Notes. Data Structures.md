# Introduction
* **Computer Science:*** is about solving problems by designing algorithms that can be converted into efficient programs. 
  The key challenge is to optimize the **time** and **memory**. Time > Memory (Importance).
* **Data Structures:** The way you organize data. It focuses on:
	  - **Organization of data:** how elements are arranged like in arrays (linear) or trees (hierarchical).
	  - **Accessing methods:**  how data is retrieved like indexing (arrays).
	  - **Degree of association:** relationships between elements like sequences (arrays), networks (graphs).
	  - **Processing methods:** operations like insertion, deletion, searching.
* **Algorithms:** The process of solving problems using the organized data (data structure).
* **Efficient Program:** Data Structure + Algorithm.
## Primitive Data Structures
Basic data types provided by a programming language. Ex: `int`, `float`, `char`, `bool`.
**Operations:** addition, subtraction, comparison.
## Non-Primitive Data Structures
More complex data structures built using primitive types.
### Derived Data Structures
**Built-in** data types derived from primitive ones. Ex: Arrays, stacks, queues, linked lists.
**Operations**: Insert, delete, access by index, or push/pop.
### User-Defined Data Structures
Custom structures created by the programmer. Ex: Classes, structs, trees, graphs.
**Operations**: Defined by the user, such as adding nodes in a tree or connecting edges in a graph.

## Linear Data Structure
Data elements are arranged sequentially, with each element having a unique successor and predecessor (except the first and last). Ex: Arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues.
**Operations**: Access, insert, delete, traverse in a linear order.
## Non Linear Data Structure
Data elements are arranged in a hierarchical or interconnected manner, with no strict sequence. Ex: Trees, graphs.
**Operations**: Traversal (e.g., depth-first, breadth-first), insert, delete based on hierarchical or networked relationships.

## Homogeneous Data
A collection of data elements of the same type. Ex: An array of integers `[1, 2, 3, 4]` or a list of strings `["apple", "banana", "cherry"]`.
## Heterogeneous Data
A collection of data elements of different types. Ex: A Python tuple `("apple", 3, True)` containing a string, an integer, and a boolean.

# Array
A **linear, homogeneous** data structure storing elements of the same type in contiguous memory locations.
**Properties**:
- **Fixed Size**: The size is set at creation and cannot be changed.
- **Index-based Access**: Allows constant-time (`O(1)`) access to elements via index.
- **Homogeneous Elements**: All elements are of the same data type.
- **Efficient Read/Write**: Fast access but inserting/deleting elements (except at the end) requires shifting.

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int arr[5] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}; // Array of integers with fixed size 5
    printf("%d", arr[2]);         // Output: 3
    return 0;
}
```

* dataType arrayName[arraySize]
* dataType arrayName[arraySize] = {1,2,3,4,5}
* dataType arrayName[] = {1,2,3,4,5}

```python
arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]  # Array (list) of integers
print(arr[2])          # Output: 3
```

## Size of an Array
$$\text{Number of elements} = \text{(Upper Bound - Lower Bound ) + 1}$$
Where:
* **Lower bound** is the index of the first element of the array
* **Upper bound** is the index of the last element of the array

$$\text{Size of an Array} = \text{Number of elements} * \text{Size of each elements in Bytes} $$
```python
arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] # each element size: 8 Bytes
```
* Number of elements = (4 - 0) + 1 = 5
* Size of the array = 5 * 8 = 40 Bytes
## Address of the Element at $k^{th}$ index
### One Dimensional Array
$$\text{Address of Element at $k^{th}$ index} = \text{Base Address} + \text{Size of each element} * (k^{th} \text{index} - \text{Lower Bound})$$

**Where:**
* $(k^{th} \text{index} - \text{Lower Bound})$ = Number of elements before the $k^{th} \text{index}$ 

#### Q1.
An array has been declared as follows
**A**: array $[-6 \text{ ----- } 6]$ of elements where every element takes 4 bytes, if the base address of the array is 3500 find the address of $array[0]$?
LB = -6
UP = 6
Base Address = 3500
Element Size = 4Bytes
K-th Index = 0
Address of K-th Index = $3500 + 4 (0 - (-6)) = 3500 + 4 (0+6) = 3500 + 24 = 3524$
#### Q2.
A program P reads in 500 integers in the range $([0...100])$ experimenting the scores of 500 students. It then prints the frequency of each score above 50. What would be the best way for P to store the frequencies? **`(GATE - 2005) (2 Marks)  Asked in Cognizant 2016`**

**(A) An array of 50 numbers**  (Answer)
(B) An array of 100 numbers  
(C) An array of 500 numbers  
(D) A dynamically allocated array of 550 numbers
## Two Dimensional Array
A two-dimensional (2D) array is a grid-like data structure with **rows** and **columns**, allowing elements to be stored in a table format.
- **Example**: Think of it like a matrix with rows and columns.
```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int arr[3][3] = { {1, 2, 3}, {4, 5, 6}, {7, 8, 9} }; // 3x3 matrix
    printf("%d", arr[1][2]); // Output: 6
    return 0;
}
```

```python
arr = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]]  # 3x3 matrix
print(arr[1][2])  # Output: 6
```

### Row Major implementation of 2D Array (Default Method)
In row-major order, a 2D array is stored row by row in contiguous memory. Elements in the same row are stored next to each other.
![[Pasted image 20241026195344.png]]
#### Row Major Implementation of a 2D Array

**Formula for Address Calculation:**

```
Address of a[i][j] = B + W * [(U2 - L2 + 1) * (i - L1) + (j - L2)]
```

Address of array **a**:
$$
a[i][j] = B + W * [(U2 - L2 + 1) * (i - L1) + (j - L2)]
$$

**Where:**
- **B** = Base address of the array
- **W** = Size of each element (in bytes)
- **L1** = Lower bound of rows
- **U1** = Upper bound of rows
- **L2** = Lower bound of columns
- **U2** = Upper bound of columns
- **(U2 - L2 + 1)** = Number of columns in the array
- **(i - L1)** = Number of rows before row `i`
- **(j - L2)** = Number of elements before column `j` in the current row

**Explanation:**
- The address of an element `a[i][j]` is calculated based on the base address, the size of each element, and the relative positions of row `i` and column `j` from their respective lower bounds.
- The calculation involves determining how far the element is from the beginning of the array, considering it in a row-wise order.

**Example:**

Consider a 2D array `a` with:
- Base address (B) = 1000
- Element size (W) = 4 bytes
- Row index bounds: `L1 = 1`, `U1 = 3`
- Column index bounds: `L2 = 1`, `U2 = 4`

Find the address of `a[2][3]`:

1. **Number of Columns (U2 - L2 + 1)** = `4 - 1 + 1 = 4`
2. **Rows before `i = 2`**: `(i - L1) = 2 - 1 = 1`
3. **Elements before `j = 3` in the current row**: `(j - L2) = 3 - 1 = 2`

**Address Calculation:**
```
Address of a[2][3] = B + W * [(4) * (1) + (2)]
                   = 1000 + 4 * (4 + 2)
                   = 1000 + 4 * 6
                   = 1000 + 24
                   = 1024
```

**Address of `a[2][3]` = 1024**

### Column Major Implementation of 2D Array
In column-major order, a 2D array is stored column by column in contiguous memory. Elements in the same column are stored next to each other.
![[Pasted image 20241026195329.png]]
#### Column Major Implementation of a 2D Array

**Note:** Just change this part from Row-Major (U2 - L2 + 1) to (U1 - L1 + 1) and get the Column-Major Implementation.

**Formula for Address Calculation:**

```
Address of a[i][j] = B + W * [(U1 - L1 + 1) * (j - L2) + (i - L1)]
```

Address of array **a**:
$$
a[i][j] = B + W * [(U1 - L1 + 1) * (j - L2) + (i - L1)]
$$

**Where:**
- **B** = Base address of the array
- **W** = Size of each element (in bytes)
- **L1** = Lower bound of rows
- **U1** = Upper bound of rows
- **L2** = Lower bound of columns
- **U2** = Upper bound of columns
- **(U1 - L1 + 1)** = Number of rows in the array
- **(j - L2)** = Number of columns before column `j`
- **(i - L1)** = Number of elements before row `i` in the current column

**Explanation:**
- The address of an element `a[i][j]` is calculated based on the base address, the size of each element, and the relative positions of column `j` and row `i` from their respective lower bounds.
- The calculation involves determining how far the element is from the beginning of the array, considering it in a column-wise order.

**Example:**

Consider a 2D array `a` with:
- Base address (B) = 1000
- Element size (W) = 4 bytes
- Row index bounds: `L1 = 1`, `U1 = 3`
- Column index bounds: `L2 = 1`, `U2 = 4`

Find the address of `a[2][3]`:

1. **Number of Rows (U1 - L1 + 1)** = `3 - 1 + 1 = 3`
2. **Columns before `j = 3`**: `(j - L2) = 3 - 1 = 2`
3. **Elements before `i = 2` in the current column**: `(i - L1) = 2 - 1 = 1`

**Address Calculation:**
```
Address of a[2][3] = B + W * [(3) * (2) + (1)]
                   = 1000 + 4 * (6 + 1)
                   = 1000 + 4 * 7
                   = 1000 + 28
                   = 1028
```

**Address of `a[2][3]` = 1028**

**Note:** Row-major is the default in most languages, while column-major is used in certain languages like Fortran.

### Q1.
Let A be a two-dimensional array declared as follows:

```
A: array [1 ... 10] [1 ... 15] of integer;
```

Assuming that each integer takes one memory location, the array is stored in row-major order, and the first element of the array is stored at location 100, what is the address of the element `a[i][j]`?

- **(A)** 15i + j + 84 (Answer)
- **(B)** 15j + i + 84
- **(C)** 10i + j + 89
- **(D)** 10j + i + 89

---

#### Solution:

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Identify Given Information:**
   - **Array Declaration**: `A[1...10][1...15]`
   - **Memory Location of First Element** (`B`): `100`
   - **Element Size (`W`)**: `1` (since each integer takes one memory location)
   - **Row Major Order**

2. **Bounds:**
   - **Row Lower Bound (`L1`)**: `1`
   - **Row Upper Bound (`U1`)**: `10`
   - **Column Lower Bound (`L2`)**: `1`
   - **Column Upper Bound (`U2`)**: `15`

3. **Row Major Address Formula:**
   ```
   Address of a[i][j] = B + W * [(U2 - L2 + 1) * (i - L1) + (j - L2)]
   ```

4. **Plugging in the Values:**
   - **Base Address (`B`)**: `100`
   - **Element Size (`W`)**: `1`
   - **Number of Columns (`U2 - L2 + 1`)**: `15 - 1 + 1 = 15`
   - **Row Position (`i - L1`)**: `i - 1`
   - **Column Position (`j - L2`)**: `j - 1`

   **Address Calculation:**
   ```
   Address of a[i][j] = 100 + 1 * [15 * (i - 1) + (j - 1)]
                      = 100 + [15i - 15 + j - 1]
                      = 100 + 15i + j - 16
                      = 15i + j + 84
   ```

5. **Final Answer:**
   - The correct option is:
   - **(A) 15i + j + 84**

---

Thus, the address of the element `a[i][j]` is given by **15i + j + 84**.

### Q2.
### **Question:**
Two matrices `M1` and `M2` are to be stored in arrays `A` and `B` respectively. Each array can be stored either in row-major or column-major order in contiguous memory locations. The time complexity of an algorithm to compute `M1 × M2` will be:

- **(A)** best if `A` is in row-major, and `B` is in column-major order.
- **(B)** best if both are in row-major order.
- **(C)** best if both are in column-major order.
- **(D)** independent of the storage scheme. (Answer)

The reason for this is that the **time complexity** of multiplying two matrices `M1` and `M2` is fundamentally independent of how the matrices are stored—whether in row-major or column-major order. The number of operations required to multiply the matrices remains the same regardless of the storage format. While the performance (in terms of cache efficiency) might vary with different storage schemes, **time complexity analysis** focuses on the number of operations rather than the low-level memory access patterns. Therefore, the correct answer is that the time complexity is not dependent on whether the matrices are stored in row-major or column-major order, making the answer **independent of the storage scheme**.

If the question had asked about the **best performance** (rather than complexity), then storing `M1` in row-major order and `M2` in column-major order would provide a performance boost due to better cache usage, which is where the confusion might come from.

### Q3.
An `n x n` array `v` is defined as follows:

```
v[i, j] = i - j for all i, j, 1 <= i <= n, 1 <= j <= n
```

The sum of the elements of the array `v` is:

- **(A)** 0
- **(B)** n - 1
- **(C)** n² - 3n + 2
- **(D)** n² (n + 1) / 2

**Step-by-Step Analysis:**

1. **Definition of Array Elements:**
   - Each element of the `n x n` array `v` is defined as `v[i, j] = i - j`.
   - This means that for any element `v[i, j]`, the value is obtained by subtracting column index `j` from row index `i`.

2. **Array Pattern and Summation:**
   - Let's consider the structure of the matrix for better understanding:
   - For an `n x n` array, if we examine the values, we see that:
     - When `i = j`, `v[i, j] = 0`.
     - When `i > j`, `v[i, j]` is positive.
     - When `i < j`, `v[i, j]` is negative.
   - The overall pattern of the matrix is symmetric with values balancing out.

3. **Observing the Sum:**
   - Let’s consider the contribution of each element. Since `v[i, j] = i - j`, we have negative values below the main diagonal and positive values above the main diagonal.
   - If we consider the entire matrix, every positive value above the diagonal is exactly canceled out by a corresponding negative value below the diagonal.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - Therefore, the **sum of all elements of the array** is `0`.

**Final Answer:**
- **(A) 0**

### Q4. GATE - 2015, 2 Marks
A Young tableau is a 2D array of integers increasing from left to right and from top to bottom. Any unfilled entries are marked with `∞`, and hence there cannot be any entry to the right of or below `∞`. The following Young tableau consists of unique entries:

```
1    2     5    14
3    4     6    23
10   12   18    25
31   ∞    ∞     ∞
```

When an element is removed from a Young tableau, other elements should be moved into its place so that the resulting table is still a Young tableau (unfilled entries may be filled in with `∞`). The minimum number of entries (other than `1`) to be shifted, to remove `1` from the given Young tableau is:

- **(A)** 2
- **(B)** 5 (Answer)
- **(C)** 6
- **(D)** 18

**Understanding Young Tableau:**
- A Young tableau is a special type of matrix where elements are sorted row-wise from left to right and column-wise from top to bottom.
- Any unfilled cell is represented by `∞` which always follows the filled entries in both row and column directions.

**Removing an Element:**
- The problem requires removing `1` from the tableau and maintaining the Young tableau property.
- After removing an element, it is necessary to replace it with an appropriate element from either the next row or column so that the tableau retains its order properties.

**Step-by-Step Process:**
1. **Remove `1`**:
   - We need to fill the vacant position at `v[1][1]` (i.e., the position of `1`).
  
2. **Shifting Elements to Maintain Order**:
   - The general rule for filling the empty spot in a Young tableau is to either move the element from the right or from below.
   - In this case, `2` (from the first row and second column) will replace `1`.
   - After placing `2` in the first spot, we need to maintain the tableau property for the rest of the cells.
  
3. **Subsequent Shifts**:
   - `5` will move to the place of `2`.
   - `14` will move to the place of `5`.
   - This shifting continues until the vacant spot reaches the position of `∞`.

**Minimum Number of Shifts:**
- The number of elements that need to be shifted to maintain the Young tableau property is **5**.

Thus, the correct answer is:

**(B) 5**.

### Q5. GATE 2014
Let `A` be a square matrix of size `n x n`. Consider the following program. What is the expected output?

``` 
C = 100
for i = 1 to n do
{
    for j = 1 to n do
    {
        Temp = A[i][j]
        A[i][j] = A[j][i]
        A[j][i] = Temp
    }
}
for i = 1 to n do
    for j = 1 to n do
        Output(A[i][j])
```

**Options:**

- **(A)** The matrix `A` itself
- **(B)** Transpose of matrix `A`
- **(C)** Adding 100 to the upper diagonal elements and subtracting 100 from diagonal elements of `A`
- **(D)** None of the above

#### Step-by-Step Analysis of the Code:

1. **Understanding the Swapping Logic:**
   - The given code swaps the elements of matrix `A` with itself.
   - Specifically, it swaps `A[i][j]` with `A[j][i]` for each element, effectively attempting to transpose the matrix.
   
2. **Nested Loop Behavior:**
   - The first `for` loop runs from `i = 1 to n`.
   - Inside the first loop, there is a second loop running from `j = 1 to n`.
   - If we look closely, when `i` equals `j`, we are swapping diagonal elements (`A[i][j]` with `A[j][i]`), which does not change anything.
   - Moreover, since the outer loop runs for all values from `i = 1 to n` and the inner loop also runs for all values from `j = 1 to n`, every element is swapped **twice**.

3. **Impact of Double Swapping:**
   - For each element, the swap operation is executed twice:
     - The first swap exchanges `A[i][j]` with `A[j][i]`.
     - The second swap restores the original values since it swaps back.
   - Therefore, the net effect of this double swap is **no change** to the original matrix.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - Since each element is swapped twice, the matrix remains unchanged after both loops complete.
   - Thus, the expected output is the original matrix `A`.

**Correct Answer:**
- **(A) The matrix A itself**

### Q6. GATE - 2014, 1 Mark
Suppose you are given an array `s[1...n]` and a procedure `reverse(s, i, j)` which reverses the order of elements between positions `i` and `j` (both inclusive). What does the following sequence do, where `1 < k < n`?

```
reverse(s, 1, k);
reverse(s, k + 1, n);
reverse(s, 1, n);
```

**Options:**
- **(A)** Rotates `s` left by `k` positions (Answer)
- **(B)** Leaves `s` unchanged
- **(C)** Reverses all elements of `s`
- **(D)** None of the above

**Correct Answer:**
- **(A) Rotates `s` left by `k` positions**

**Explanation with Example (k = 3, Array Size n = 8):**

Consider an array `s = [a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h]` and `k = 3`.

**Step 1:** Reverse the first `k` elements (`reverse(s, 1, k)`):
- `s` becomes: `[c, b, a, d, e, f, g, h]`

**Step 2:** Reverse the elements from `k + 1` to `n` (`reverse(s, k + 1, n)`):
- `s` becomes: `[c, b, a, h, g, f, e, d]`

**Step 3:** Reverse the entire array (`reverse(s, 1, n)`):
- `s` becomes: `[d, e, f, g, h, a, b, c]`

**Result:**
The sequence of operations effectively **rotates the array `s` to the left by `k` positions**.

This rotation is equivalent to shifting each element to the left by `k` positions and wrapping the initial `k` elements around to the end. The updated output shows that the correct answer is **Option A**, which rotates the array left by `k` positions.

# Stack (LIFO)
A **stack** is an **abstract data structure** that manages a collection of elements with strict ordering rules. Specifically, stacks operate under the **Last In, First Out** (LIFO) principle, where the last element added is the first to be removed. Think of it like a stack of plates: you add plates to the top and remove them from the top as well.

Stacks are particularly useful in scenarios where you need temporary storage and simple, linear access. They're used in memory management, parsing expressions, and in implementing recursive functions in programming languages, as each function call and return is handled using a stack in the call stack of an operating system.

## Main Properties of Stack for GATE Exam

1. **LIFO Structure**: Only the top element is accessible, and only the last added element can be removed first.
2. **Basic Operations**: Key operations include:
   - **Push** (add an element to the top),
   - **Pop** (remove the top element),
   - **Peek** or **Top** (view the top element without removing it).
3. **Overflow and Underflow**: Important edge cases in stack operations:
   - **Overflow** occurs when trying to push onto a full stack.
   - **Underflow** happens when trying to pop from an empty stack.
4. **Memory Management**: Stacks are used by operating systems to manage function calls, return addresses, and local variables during program execution.
5. **Applications in Algorithms**:
   - **Expression Parsing and Evaluation**: Stacks are used to evaluate expressions and convert infix expressions to postfix or prefix.
   - **Backtracking Algorithms**: For instance, solving mazes or puzzles where you need to backtrack steps.
   - **DFS (Depth-First Search)**: DFS uses a stack to keep track of the vertices to be explored in graph traversal.
### 1. Array Implementation of Stack
In an array-based implementation:
- **Structure**: The stack is implemented using a fixed-size array, which has a predefined capacity. A variable `top` is used to track the index of the top element in the stack.
- **Operations**:
  - **Push**: Adds an element at the position pointed to by `top` and then increments `top`. If `top` exceeds the maximum array size, a **stack overflow** condition occurs.
  - **Pop**: Decrements `top` and returns the element at that position. If `top` is -1 (empty stack), it triggers a **stack underflow**.
  - **Peek**: Returns the element at the current `top` without modifying the stack.
- **Advantages**: Simple to implement with constant time complexity \(O(1)\) for all operations.
- **Disadvantages**: The stack size is fixed, so memory allocation may be inefficient if the stack is not fully utilized, and resizing is not dynamic【29†source】【30†source】.

### 2. Linked List Implementation of Stack
In a linked list-based implementation:
- **Structure**: The stack is represented as a singly linked list where each node contains data and a pointer to the next node. The `top` pointer points to the head of the list (most recent element).
- **Operations**:
  - **Push**: A new node is created, its next pointer is set to the current `top`, and then `top` is updated to this new node. This allows dynamic resizing, avoiding overflow.
  - **Pop**: The node at `top` is removed, and `top` is updated to the next node. Underflow occurs if `top` is `null`.
  - **Peek**: Accesses the data in the node at `top`.
- **Advantages**: Dynamic memory allocation means no fixed size; the stack grows and shrinks as needed without overflow (as long as memory is available).
- **Disadvantages**: Slightly more complex due to pointer manipulation, and operations require additional memory to store pointers【21†source】【29†source】.

### Comparison Summary for GATE
- **Efficiency**: Both implementations offer \(O(1)\) complexity for push, pop, and peek operations.
- **Memory Management**: Array-based stacks are limited by fixed capacity, while linked list-based stacks can dynamically adjust in size.
- **Use Case**: Arrays are simpler for smaller, fixed-size stacks, while linked lists are suitable for scenarios where stack size may vary dynamically.

### Q1. GATE 1991 Question (2 Marks)
Choose the correct alternatives (more than one may be correct) and write the corresponding letters only. The following sequence of operations is performed on a stack:

- PUSH (10), PUSH (20), POP, PUSH (10), PUSH (20), POP, POP, POP, PUSH (20), POP.

The sequence of values popped out is?

**Options:**
- a) 20, 10, 20, 10, 20
- b) 20, 20, 10, 10, 20
- c) 10, 20, 20, 10, 20
- d) 20, 20, 10, 20, 10

Following the operations step-by-step:
1. PUSH 10 → Stack: [10]
2. PUSH 20 → Stack: [10, 20]
3. POP → Remove 20. Sequence: [20]
4. PUSH 10 → Stack: [10, 10]
5. PUSH 20 → Stack: [10, 10, 20]
6. POP → Remove 20. Sequence: [20, 20]
7. POP → Remove 10. Sequence: [20, 20, 10]
8. POP → Remove 10. Sequence: [20, 20, 10, 10]
9. PUSH 20 → Stack: [20]
10. POP → Remove 20. Sequence: [20, 20, 10, 10, 20]

**Answer:** The correct sequence is **(b) 20, 20, 10, 10, 20**.
### Q2.
1. **(A)** In push operation, if new nodes are inserted at the beginning of the linked list, then in pop operation, nodes must be removed from the end.
2. **(B)** In push operation, if new nodes are inserted at the end, then in pop operation, nodes must be removed from the beginning.
3. **(C)** Both of the above.
4. **(D)** None of the above.

#### Thought Process:
In a **stack implementation using a linked list**, the primary rule of stack operations (Last In, First Out or LIFO) should be maintained:
- The most recent element added (pushed) is the first to be removed (popped).
- To achieve this efficiently, we typically add and remove elements from the same end of the list.

**Analysis of Each Statement**:
- **Statement (A)**: This suggests adding nodes at the beginning and removing from the end, which contradicts the LIFO property of a stack, as elements added last would not be removed first.
- **Statement (B)**: This implies adding nodes at the end and removing from the beginning, which follows a First In, First Out (FIFO) order, more like a queue, not a stack.

Both statements **(A)** and **(B)** describe behaviors contrary to a stack’s LIFO nature, making them incorrect. In a proper linked list stack implementation, we should add and remove nodes from the **same end** (typically the beginning for efficiency) to maintain LIFO.

#### Conclusion:
The correct answer is **(D) None of the above**, as neither (A) nor (B) accurately represents a linked list implementation of a stack that follows LIFO. 

This analysis aligns with stack properties and linked list implementations discussed in data structure references, which recommend adding and removing nodes from the head to maintain efficient LIFO operations.

### Q3.

**GATE 2004 Question (2 Marks)**

**Question:**
A single array $A[1 \ldots \text{MAXSIZE}]$ is used to implement two stacks. The two stacks grow from opposite ends of the array. Variables `top_1` and `top_2` (`top_1 < top_2`) point to the topmost element of each stack. To use the space efficiently, the condition for "stack full" is:

**Options:**
- (A) $\text{top}_1 = \frac{\text{MAXSIZE}}{2}$ and $\text{top}_2 = \frac{\text{MAXSIZE}}{2} + 1$
- (B) $\text{top}_1 + \text{top}_2 = \text{MAXSIZE}$
- (C) $(\text{top}_1 = \frac{\text{MAXSIZE}}{2})$ or $(\text{top}_2 = \text{MAXSIZE})$
- (D) $\text{top}_1 = \text{top}_2 - 1$

When implementing two stacks in a single array growing from opposite ends, the **stack full** condition arises when the two stacks meet in the middle, leaving no additional space between them.

1. **Stack 1** grows from the beginning of the array (index 1) towards the center.
2. **Stack 2** grows from the end of the array (index $\text{MAXSIZE}$) towards the center.

The array is considered **full** when $\text{top}_1$ is immediately before $\text{top}_2$, i.e.,
$$
\text{top}_1 = \text{top}_2 - 1
$$

This condition ensures maximum usage of the array space without overlap between the two stacks.

**Correct Answer:**  
**(D) $\text{top}_1 = \text{top}_2 - 1$**
