# Introduction
* **Computer Science:*** is about solving problems by designing algorithms that can be converted into efficient programs. 
  The key challenge is to optimize the **time** and **memory**. Time > Memory (Importance).
* **Data Structures:** The way you organize data. It focuses on:
	  - **Organization of data:** how elements are arranged like in arrays (linear) or trees (hierarchical).
	  - **Accessing methods:**  how data is retrieved like indexing (arrays).
	  - **Degree of association:** relationships between elements like sequences (arrays), networks (graphs).
	  - **Processing methods:** operations like insertion, deletion, searching.
* **Algorithms:** The process of solving problems using the organized data (data structure).
* **Efficient Program:** Data Structure + Algorithm.
## Primitive Data Structures
Basic data types provided by a programming language. Ex: `int`, `float`, `char`, `bool`.
**Operations:** addition, subtraction, comparison.
## Non-Primitive Data Structures
More complex data structures built using primitive types.
### Derived Data Structures
**Built-in** data types derived from primitive ones. Ex: Arrays, stacks, queues, linked lists.
**Operations**: Insert, delete, access by index, or push/pop.
### User-Defined Data Structures
Custom structures created by the programmer. Ex: Classes, structs, trees, graphs.
**Operations**: Defined by the user, such as adding nodes in a tree or connecting edges in a graph.

## Linear Data Structure
Data elements are arranged sequentially, with each element having a unique successor and predecessor (except the first and last). Ex: Arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues.
**Operations**: Access, insert, delete, traverse in a linear order.
## Non Linear Data Structure
Data elements are arranged in a hierarchical or interconnected manner, with no strict sequence. Ex: Trees, graphs.
**Operations**: Traversal (e.g., depth-first, breadth-first), insert, delete based on hierarchical or networked relationships.

## Homogeneous Data
A collection of data elements of the same type. Ex: An array of integers `[1, 2, 3, 4]` or a list of strings `["apple", "banana", "cherry"]`.
## Heterogeneous Data
A collection of data elements of different types. Ex: A Python tuple `("apple", 3, True)` containing a string, an integer, and a boolean.

# Array
A **linear, homogeneous** data structure storing elements of the same type in contiguous memory locations.
**Properties**:
- **Fixed Size**: The size is set at creation and cannot be changed.
- **Index-based Access**: Allows constant-time (`O(1)`) access to elements via index.
- **Homogeneous Elements**: All elements are of the same data type.
- **Efficient Read/Write**: Fast access but inserting/deleting elements (except at the end) requires shifting.

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int arr[5] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}; // Array of integers with fixed size 5
    printf("%d", arr[2]);         // Output: 3
    return 0;
}
```

* dataType arrayName[arraySize]
* dataType arrayName[arraySize] = {1,2,3,4,5}
* dataType arrayName[] = {1,2,3,4,5}

```python
arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]  # Array (list) of integers
print(arr[2])          # Output: 3
```

## Size of an Array
$$\text{Number of elements} = \text{(Upper Bound - Lower Bound ) + 1}$$
Where:
* **Lower bound** is the index of the first element of the array
* **Upper bound** is the index of the last element of the array

$$\text{Size of an Array} = \text{Number of elements} * \text{Size of each elements in Bytes} $$
```python
arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] # each element size: 8 Bytes
```
* Number of elements = (4 - 0) + 1 = 5
* Size of the array = 5 * 8 = 40 Bytes
## Address of the Element at $k^{th}$ index
### One Dimensional Array
$$\text{Address of Element at $k^{th}$ index} = \text{Base Address} + \text{Size of each element} * (k^{th} \text{index} - \text{Lower Bound})$$

**Where:**
* $(k^{th} \text{index} - \text{Lower Bound})$ = Number of elements before the $k^{th} \text{index}$ 

#### Q1.
An array has been declared as follows
**A**: array $[-6 \text{ ----- } 6]$ of elements where every element takes 4 bytes, if the base address of the array is 3500 find the address of $array[0]$?
LB = -6
UP = 6
Base Address = 3500
Element Size = 4Bytes
K-th Index = 0
Address of K-th Index = $3500 + 4 (0 - (-6)) = 3500 + 4 (0+6) = 3500 + 24 = 3524$
#### Q2.
A program P reads in 500 integers in the range $([0...100])$ experimenting the scores of 500 students. It then prints the frequency of each score above 50. What would be the best way for P to store the frequencies? **`(GATE - 2005) (2 Marks)  Asked in Cognizant 2016`**

**(A) An array of 50 numbers**  (Answer)
(B) An array of 100 numbers  
(C) An array of 500 numbers  
(D) A dynamically allocated array of 550 numbers
## Two Dimensional Array
A two-dimensional (2D) array is a grid-like data structure with **rows** and **columns**, allowing elements to be stored in a table format.
- **Example**: Think of it like a matrix with rows and columns.
```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int arr[3][3] = { {1, 2, 3}, {4, 5, 6}, {7, 8, 9} }; // 3x3 matrix
    printf("%d", arr[1][2]); // Output: 6
    return 0;
}
```

```python
arr = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]]  # 3x3 matrix
print(arr[1][2])  # Output: 6
```

### Row Major implementation of 2D Array (Default Method)
In row-major order, a 2D array is stored row by row in contiguous memory. Elements in the same row are stored next to each other.

### Column Major Implementation of 2D Array
In column-major order, a 2D array is stored column by column in contiguous memory. Elements in the same column are stored next to each other.

**Note:** Row-major is the default in most languages, while column-major is used in certain languages like Fortran.
